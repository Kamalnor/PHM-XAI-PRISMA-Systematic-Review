This is only possible if the users’ perceptual and cognitive limitations are taken into account during every step of design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive displays. Visualization of medical images, if executed effectively and efficiently, can empower physicians to explore patient data rapidly and accurately with minimal cognitive effort. This article describes a specific case study in biomedical visualization system design and evaluation, which is the visualization of MR angiography images for planning arteriovenous malformation (AVM) interventions. The success of an AVM intervention greatly depends on the surgeon gaining a full understanding of the anatomy of the malformation and its surrounding structures. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of visualization modalities involving contour enhancement and stereopsis in the identification and localization of vascular structures using objective user studies. Our preliminary results indicate that contour enhancement, particularly when combined with stereopsis, results in improved performance enhancement of the perception of connectivity and relative depth between different structures.","2015-03-17","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:31","4:1–4:15","","1","12","","ACM Trans.

Numerous lncRNAs have been discovered in diverse species, but the functions of most lncRNAs still remain unclear. Meanwhile, their expression patterns and regulation mechanisms are also far from being fully understood. With the advances of high-throughput technologies, the increasing availability of genomic data creates opportunities for deciphering the molecular mechanism and underlying pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we develop an integrative framework called JONMF to identify lncRNA-mRNA co-expression modules based on the sample-matched lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles. We formulate the module detection task as an optimization problem with joint orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization that could effectively prevent multicollinearity and produce a good modularity interpretation. The constructed lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and the gene-gene interaction network are used as the network-regularized constraints to improve the module accuracy, while the sparsity constraints are simultaneously utilized to achieve modular sparse solutions. We applied JONMF to human ovarian cancer dataset and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively discover biologically functional co-expression modules, which may provide insights into the function of lncRNAs and molecular mechanism of human diseases.","2020-03-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:33","623–634","","2","17","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

As compared to recording and updating videos of human ASL signers, technology for automatically producing animation from an easy-to-update script would make maintaining ASL content on websites more efficient. Most sign language animation researchers evaluate their systems by collecting subjective judgments and comprehension-question responses from deaf participants. Through a survey (N = 62) and multiple-regression analysis, we identified relationships between (a) demographic and technology-experience characteristics of participants and (b) the subjective and objective scores collected from them during the evaluation of sign language animation systems. These relationships were experimentally verified in a subsequent user study with 57 participants, which demonstrated that specific subpopulations have higher comprehension or subjective scores when viewing sign language animations in an evaluation study. This finding indicates that researchers should collect and report a set of specific characteristics about participants in any publications describing evaluation studies of their technology, a practice that is not yet currently standard among researchers working in this field. In addition to investigating this relationship between participant characteristics and study results, we have also released our survey questions in ASL and English that can be used to measure these participant characteristics, to encourage reporting of such data in future studies.

Recent advancements in this area have proposed novel techniques that aim to detect fake news by exploring how it propagates on social networks. Nevertheless, to detect fake news at an early stage, i.e., when it is published on a news outlet but not yet spread on social media, one cannot rely on news propagation information as it does not exist. Hence, there is a strong need to develop approaches that can detect fake news by focusing on news content. In this article, a theory-driven model is proposed for fake news detection. The method investigates news content at various levels: lexicon-level, syntax-level, semantic-level, and discourse-level. We represent news at each level, relying on well-established theories in social and forensic psychology. Fake news detection is then conducted within a supervised machine learning framework. As an interdisciplinary research, our work explores potential fake news patterns, enhances the interpretability in fake news feature engineering, and studies the relationships among fake news, deception/disinformation, and clickbaits. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets indicate the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art and enable fake news early detection when there is limited content information.","2020-06-11","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:39","12:1–12:25","","2","1","","Digital Threats: Research and Practice","Fake News Early Detection","","","","","","","","","","","","July 2020","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\YR9T9X3K\Zhou et al. - 2020 - Fake News Early Detection A Theory-driven Model.pdf","","","click-bait; disinformation; Fake news; fake news detection; feature engineering; interdisciplinary research; news verification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reason for this is that a puzzle can be seen as an enjoyable educational activity in the form of a game but also as a complex activity that archaeologists undertake when re-assembling fragments, for instance, of broken pottery. Until now the creation of this type of experiences is mostly a manual process and the artefacts used rarely reflect those in the collection due to the complex nature of the process. The contribution of this article is a novel digital worfklow for the design and fabrication of 3D puzzles that overcomes these limitations. The input to the workflow is an authentic artefact from a heritage collection, which is then digitised using technologies such as 3D scanning and 3D modelling. Thereafter, a puzzle generator system produces the puzzle pieces using a cell fracture algorithm and generates a set of puzzle pieces (female) and a single core piece (male) for fabrication. Finally, the pieces are fabricated using 3D printing technology and post-processed to facilitate the puzzle assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed novel workflow, we deployed it to create a puzzle activity of the Saltdean urn, which is exhibited at the Archaeology Gallery of the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery. The workflow is also used with further artefacts to demonstrate its applicability to other shapes. The significance of this research is that it eases the task of creating puzzle-like activities and maintaining them in the long term within a busy public space such as a museum gallery.","2020-02-15","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:40","6:1–6:22","","1","13","","J.

Traditional work has focused on mass-univariate statistical approaches that identify important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with quantitative traits (QTs) of brain structure or function. More recently, to address the problem of multiple comparison and weak detection, multivariate analysis methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) are often used to select the most relevant SNPs associated with QTs. However, one problem of Lasso, as well as many other feature selection methods for imaging genetics, is that some useful prior information, e.g., the hierarchical structure among SNPs, are rarely used for designing a more powerful model. In this paper, we propose to identify the associations between candidate genetic features (i.e., SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures using a tree-guided sparse learning (TGSL) method. The advantage of our method is that it explicitly models the complex hierarchical structure among the SNPs in the objective function for feature selection. Specifically, motivated by the biological knowledge, the hierarchical structures involving gene groups and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks as well as individual SNPs are imposed as a tree-guided regularization term in our TGSL model. Experimental studies on simulation data and the Alzheimer&#x0027;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data show that our method not only achieves better predictions than competing methods on the MRI-derived measures of AD-related region of interests (ROIs) (i.e., hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus), but also identifies sparse SNP patterns at the block level to better guide the biological interpretation.","2019-11-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:42","1986–1996","","6","16","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

We argue that the goal of the person using the system, and the pattern of behavior that they exhibit as they proceed to attain that goal, should be incorporated into the methods and techniques used to evaluate the effectiveness of IR systems, so that the resulting effectiveness scores have a useful interpretation that corresponds to the users’ search experience. In particular, we investigate the role of search task complexity, and show that it has a direct bearing on the number of relevant answer documents sought by users in response to an information need, suggesting that useful effectiveness metrics must be goal sensitive. We further suggest that user behavior while scanning results listings is affected by the rate at which their goal is being realized, and hence that appropriate effectiveness metrics must be adaptive to the presence (or not) of relevant documents in the ranking. In response to these two observations, we present a new effectiveness metric, INST, that has both of the desired properties: INST employs a parameter T, a direct measure of the user’s search goal that adjusts the top-weightedness of the evaluation score; moreover, as progress towards the target T is made, the modeled user behavior is adapted, to reflect the remaining expectations. INST is experimentally compared to previous effectiveness metrics, including Average Precision (AP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Rank-Biased Precision (RBP), demonstrating our claims as to INST’s usefulness. Like RBP, INST is a weighted-precision metric, meaning that each score can be accompanied by a residual that quantifies the extent of the score uncertainty caused by unjudged documents. As part of our experimentation, we use crowd-sourced data and score residuals to demonstrate that a wide range of queries arise for even quite specific information needs, and that these variant queries introduce significant levels of residual uncertainty into typical experimental evaluations. These causes of variability have wide-reaching implications for experiment design, and for the construction of test collections.","2017-06-05","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:43","24:1–24:38","","3","35","","ACM Trans.

Human brain is “the most complex object in the universe,” and brain imaging data (BID) are routinely of multiple/many attributes and highly non-stationary. These are determined by the nature of BID as the recordings of the evolving processes of the brain(s) under examination in various views. Driven by the increasingly high demands for precision, efficiency, and reliability in neuro-science and engineering tasks, dimensionality reduction has become a priority issue in BID analysis to handle the notoriously high dimensionality and large scale of big BID sets as well as the enormously complicated interdependencies among data elements. This has become particularly urgent and challenging in this big data era. Dimensionality reduction theories and methods manifest unrivaled potential in revealing key insights to BID via offering the low-dimensional/tiny representations/features, which may preserve critical characterizations of massive neuronal activities and brain functional and/or malfunctional states of interest. This study surveys the most salient work along this direction conforming to a 3-dimensional taxonomy with respect to (1) the scale of BID, of which the design with this consideration is important for the potential applications; (2) the order of BID, in which a higher order denotes more BID attributes manipulatable by the method; and (3) linearity, in which the method’s degree of linearity largely determines the “fidelity” in BID exploration. This study defines criteria for qualitative evaluations of these works in terms of effectiveness, interpretability, efficiency, and scalability. The classifications and evaluations based on the taxonomy provide comprehensive guides to (1) how existing research and development efforts are distributed and (2) their performance, features, and potential in influential applications especially when involving big data. In the end, this study crystallizes the open technical issues and proposes research challenges that must be solved to enable further researches in this area of great potential.","2021-05-03","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:44","87:1–87:36","","4","54","","ACM Comput.

We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work.

They are expected to fulfill the caregiving needs of managing the child's health condition and treatment while also meeting the parenting needs of translating knowledge, communicating about the illness, and making numerous decisions on a daily basis for their sick child due to the child's young age. Drawing on 15 semi-structured interviews, we examined parental caregivers' perspectives on raising a child while also managing the child's health. We identified three tensions that participants encountered as they balanced parenting and caregiving responsibilities: (i) tension between ensuring the child's health and safety and attending to the child's social development, (ii) tension between disclosing health-related information and minimizing the psychological burden on the child, and (iii) tension between rewarding the child's cooperation in treatment and maintaining discipline. Together, these tensions reveal an ongoing process through which caregivers assess and interpret their actions and responsibilities relative to anticipated consequences across multiple time scales.

Computationally, this is to represent and interpret high dimensional observations through a structural and conceptual abstraction into the most influential determinants underlying the problem. The working hypothesis of this report is to consider gene interaction to be largely responsible for the manifestation of complex cancer phenotypes, thus where the representation is to be conceptualized. Here, we report a representation learning strategy combined with regularizations, in which gene expressions are described in terms of a regularized product of meta-genes and their expression levels. The meta-genes are constrained by gene interactions thus representing their original topological contexts. The expression levels are supervised by their conditional dependencies among the observations thus providing a cluster-specific constraint. We obtain both of these structural constraints using a node-based graphical model.

We validate our representation strategy by its robust recognitions of various cancer phenotypes comparing with various classical methods. The modules discovered are either shared or specify for different types or stages of human cancers, all of which are consistent with literature and biology.","2019-09-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:47","1729–1742","","5","16","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

It continues to be a prevalent problem for many organizations where data resides in different sources and duplicates the need to be identified and managed. The term “entity matching” also loosely refers to the broader problem of determining whether two heterogeneous representations of different entities should be associated together. This problem has an even wider scope of applications, from determining the subsidiaries of companies to matching jobs to job seekers, which has impactful consequences. In this article, we first report our recent system DITTO, which is an example of a modern entity matching system based on pretrained language models. Then we summarize recent solutions in applying deep learning and pre-trained language models for solving the entity matching task. Finally, we discuss research directions beyond entity matching, including the promise of synergistically integrating blocking and entity matching steps together, the need to examine methods to alleviate steep training data requirements that are typical of deep learning or pre-trained language models, and the importance of generalizing entity matching solutions to handle the broader entity matching problem, which leads to an even more pressing need to explain matching outcomes.","2021-01-06","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:48","1:1–1:17","","1","13","","J.

In a scenario of increasing competition on digital services, ISQ is a competitive differentiation asset. In this regard, managing, maintaining, and evolving IT infrastructures have become a primary concern of organizations. Thus, a technical perspective on ISQ provides useful guidance to meet current challenges. The financial sector is paradigmatic, since it is a traditional business, with highly complex business-critical legacy systems, facing a tremendous change due to market and regulation drivers. We carried out a Mixed-Methods study, performing a Delphi-like study on the financial sector. We developed a specific research framework to pursue this vertical study. Data were collected in four phases starting with a high-level randomly stratified panel of 13 senior managers and then a target panel of 124 carefully selected and well-informed domain experts. We have identified and dealt with several quality factors; they were discussed in a comprehensive model inspired by the ISO 25010, 42010, and 12207 standards, corresponding to software quality, software architecture, and software process, respectively. Our results suggest that the relationship among quality, architecture, and process is a valuable technical perspective to explain the quality of an information system. Thus, we introduce and illustrate a novel meta-model, named SQuAP (Software Quality, Architecture, Process), which is intended to give a comprehensive picture of ISQ by abstracting and connecting detailed individual ISO models.","2018-09-26","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:49","11:1–11:38","","3","9","","ACM Trans.

In this article, we explore a multilingual translation model capable of producing fixed-size sentence representations by incorporating an intermediate crosslingual shared layer, which we refer to as attention bridge. This layer exploits the semantics from each language and develops into a language-agnostic meaning representation that can be efficiently used for transfer learning. We systematically study the impact of the size of the attention bridge and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast to related previous work, we demonstrate that there is no conflict between translation performance and the use of sentence representations in downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. Nevertheless, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial in non-trainable similarity tasks. Similarly, we show that trainable downstream tasks benefit from multilingual models, whereas additional language signals do not improve performance in non-trainable benchmarks. This is an important insight that helps to properly design models for specific applications. Finally, we also include an in-depth analysis of the proposed attention bridge and its ability to encode linguistic properties. We carefully analyze the information that is captured by individual attention heads and identify interesting patterns that explain the performance of specific settings in linguistic probing tasks.","2020-06-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 06:58:33","2021-06-14 02:36:53","387–424","","2","46","","Comput.

By bringing together the two established fields of cyber-physical systems and self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet managed autonomy, which is a main requirement for many emerging and future applications and technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are situated in a physical environment and constrained in their resources, and they understand their own state and environment and, based on that understanding, are able to make decisions autonomously at runtime in a self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How can we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii) What are effective infrastructures for implementing self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be required to engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We review each of these challenges in some detail and emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a continual introspection of its own state to sensibly balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples of cyber-physical systems that may benefit from self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very different systems nevertheless have similar characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable environmental dynamics, high expectations on their reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we highlight the need for research on above listed topics.","2020-06-18","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:56","38:1–38:26","","4","4","","ACM Trans.

Therefore, the identification of potential comorbidity can help prevent those comorbid diseases when treating a primary disease. Unfortunately, most of current known disease comorbidities are discovered occasionally in clinic, and our knowledge about comorbidity is far from complete. Despite the fact that many efforts have been made to predict disease comorbidity, the prediction accuracy of existing computational approaches needs to be improved. By investigating the factors underlying disease comorbidity, e.g., mutated genes and rewired protein-protein interactions PPIs, we here present a novel algorithm to predict disease comorbidity by integrating multi-scale data ranging from genes to phenotypes. Benchmark results on real data show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms, and some of our novel predictions are validated with those reported in literature, indicating the effectiveness and predictive power of our approach. In addition, we identify some pathway and PPI patterns that underlie the co-occurrence between a primary disease and certain disease classes, which can help explain how the comorbidity is initiated from molecular perspectives.","2017-05-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:57","678–686","","3","14","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

For some applications, it is common that hash table accesses dominate the execution time. To efficiently solve these problems in parallel, we need implementations that achieve speedups in highly concurrent scenarios. Unfortunately, currently available concurrent hashing libraries are far away from this requirement, in particular, when adaptively sized tables are necessary or contention on some elements occurs. Our starting point for better performing data structures is a fast and simple lock-free concurrent hash table based on linear probing that is, however, limited to word-sized key-value types and does not support dynamic size adaptation. We explain how to lift these limitations in a provably scalable way and demonstrate that dynamic growing has a performance overhead comparable to the same generalization in sequential hash tables. We perform extensive experiments comparing the performance of our implementations with six of the most widely used concurrent hash tables. Ours are considerably faster than the best algorithms with similar restrictions and an order of magnitude faster than the best more general tables. In some extreme cases, the difference even approaches four orders of magnitude.

Storytelling is used in games regarding cultural places, but it often takes a simple form. Thus, the authors’ aim is to investigate the possibility to communicate cultural content through a narrative-based game that can function with multiple narratives. Another core element of our design is the less exploited in serious games combination of endogenous cooperation and competition. The social dimension of our design was expressed through features of Classroom Multiplayer Presential Games (CMPGs), in respect of using a one-to-many game environment projected on a single screen, while enhancing collaborative work in small teams. After providing an overview of the game, we briefly explain how this was implemented with the use of Twine, a free authoring tool for the creation of interactive stories and text-based games. Subsequently, we present the two interventions we conducted, one with teenage students (n = 19) and one with post-graduate students (n = 14), to test how our game design functions with real users. A mixed research methodology was followed in the two trials and data were collected through observation, focus group discussions, short questionnaires, and game reports. Findings indicated that the suggested design is playable but provided helpful insights into its future improvements. The game managed to engage both teenagers and adults with the cultural content and create motivation towards it. Learning gains were registered for both groups, but these were more appreciated by the adult participants, who additionally found the game to be more entertaining. The limited character of our results imposes the need for future extensive evaluation of the game design in both formal and non-formal educational contexts.","2020-12-03","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:36:59","27:1–27:28","","4","13","","J.

Gene set analysis GSA has been proposed as an alternative to single-SNP analysis with the aim of improving the power of genetic association studies. Nevertheless, most GSA methods rely on expensive computational procedures that make unfeasible their implementation in GWAS. We propose a new GSA method, referred as globalEVT, which uses the extreme value theory to derive gene-level p-values. GlobalEVT reduces dramatically the computational requirements compared to other GSA approaches. In addition, this new approach improves the power by allowing different inheritance models for each genetic variant as illustrated in the simulation study performed and allows the existence of correlation between the SNPs. Real data analysis of an Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD study illustrates the importance of using GSA approaches for exploring new susceptibility genes. Specifically, the globalEVT method is able to detect genes related to Cyclophilin A like domain proteins which is known to play an important role in the mechanisms of ADHD development.","2016-11-01","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:02","2021-06-14 02:37:00","1100–1106","","6","13","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

However, most of the variants that have been identified contribute relatively small increments of risk and only explain a small portion of the genetic variation in complex diseases. This is the so-called missing heritability problem. Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically related, meaning these diseases share common genetic risk variants. Therefore, exploring the genetic correlations across multiple related studies could be a promising strategy for removing spurious associations and identifying underlying genetic risk variants, and thereby uncovering the mystery of missing heritability in complex diseases. We present a general and robust method to identify genetic patterns from multiple large-scale genomic datasets. We treat the summary statistics as a matrix and demonstrate that genetic patterns will form a low-rank matrix plus a sparse component. Hence, we formulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem, where we aim to discover risk variants shared by multiple diseases/traits and those for each individual disease/trait. We propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our method using both synthesized datasets and real datasets. The experimental results show that our method can successfully reconstruct both the shared and the individual genetic patterns from summary statistics and achieve comparable performances compared with alternative methods under a wide range of scenarios.
