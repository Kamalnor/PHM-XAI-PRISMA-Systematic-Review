First, vibration signals are transformed into images by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A CNN is applied as classification model, and Gradient class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is utilized to generate the attention of model. By analyzing the attentions, the explanation of classification models for vibration signals analysis can be carried out. Finally, the verifications of attention are introduced by neural networks, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision trees to demonstrate the proposed results.

The crux of the problem is that these models should be explainable the model should give doctors rationales that can explain the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a visually interpretable network (VINet) which can generate diagnostic visual interpretations while making accurate diagnoses. VINet is an end-to-end model consisting of an importance estimation network and a classification network. The former produces a diagnostic visual interpretation for each case, and the classifier diagnoses the case. In the classifier, by exploring the information in the diagnostic visual interpretation, the irrelevant information in the feature maps is eliminated by our proposed feature destruction process. This allows the classification network to concentrate on the important features and use them as the primary references for classification. Through a joint optimization of higher classification accuracy and eliminating as many irrelevant features as possible, a precise, fine-grained diagnostic visual interpretation, along with an accurate diagnosis, can be produced by our proposed network simultaneously. Based on a computed tomography image dataset (LUNA16) on pulmonary nodule, extensive experiments have been conducted, demonstrating that the proposed VINet can produce state-of-the-art diagnostic visual interpretations compared with all baseline methods.","2020-07","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","1720-1729","","7","22","","","VINet","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\N2XWZAVZ\8979157.html","","","Computational modeling; Solid modeling; Task analysis; Biomedical imaging; Medical services; Visualization; Machine learning; Estimation; image classification; medical diagnostic imaging; neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in aiding disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a framework to predict the onset of AMI using 713,447 extracted ECG samples and associated auxiliary data from the longitudinal and comprehensive ECG-ViEW II database, previously unexplored in the field of machine learning in healthcare. The framework is realized with two deep learning models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a decision-tree based model, XGBoost. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was utilized to address class imbalance. High prediction accuracy of 89.9%, 84.6%, 97.5% and ROC curve areas of 90.7%, 82.9%, 96.5% have been achieved for the best CNN, RNN, and XGBoost models, respectively. Shapley values were utilized to identify the features that contributed most to the classification decision with XGBoost, demonstrating the high impact of auxiliary inputs such as age and sex. This paper demonstrates the promising application of explainable machine learning in the field of cardiovascular disease prediction.","2020","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","210410-210417","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\I7IRVYSP\Ibrahim et al. - 2020 - Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarct.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\VNLPU98W\9268965.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Predictive models; Training; Databases; predictive models; acute myocardial infarction; biomedical informatics; Electrocardiography; Myocardium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the current seizure detection approaches strongly rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation, we propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient noises. A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore, to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency. Moreover, the designed attention mechanism is demonstrated ables to provide fine-grained information for pathological analysis. We propose an effective and efficient patient-independent diagnosis approach of epileptic seizure based on raw EEG signals without manually feature engineering, which is a step toward the development of large-scale deployment for real-life use.","2020-10","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","2852-2859","","10","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\SCLAJG5F\8994148.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\4P2LMXCU\Zhang et al. - 2020 - Adversarial Representation Learning for Robust Pat.pdf","","","Informatics; adversarial deep learning; Non-invasive EEG; patient-independent; seizure detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, building an open-box machine learning system to discover explainable knowledge from gene expression data is a difficult research problem due to a large number of genes, a small number of samples, and noise. Fuzzy systems can be used to deal with data ambiguity and noise issues and extract meaningful knowledge from gene data. In this article, we create a new deep fuzzy neural network to handle the uncertainty in gene data to generate useful knowledge for specific disease diagnosis. A new hybrid algorithm is designed to preprocess data and select informative genes for accurate cancer detection. Various experiments using six different cancer datasets indicate that the new method has better and more reliable performance than the other conventional classification methods with different gene selection methods.","2020-12","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","3219-3228","","12","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\8RZJNDDB\8928970.html","","","Feature extraction; Cancer; Support vector machines; Biomarker selection; cancer detection; Cancer detection; deep fuzzy (DF) neural networks; explainable machine learning systems; feature selection; Fuzzy neural networks; Gene expression; gene expression data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural network's prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions. As a result of this research, 3,494,516 people were identified as being at risk of developing CKD in Colombia, or 7% of the total population.","2019","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","152900-152910","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BZM3MF4V\Vásquez-Morales et al. - 2019 - Explainable Prediction of Chronic Renal Disease in.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BQICKLC3\8877828.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Data models; Diseases; Training; explainable AI; Biological neural networks; case-based reasoning; Chronic kidney disease prediction; neural networks; random forest; Sociology; support vector machines; twin systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, portable ultrasound is being more widely used for its convenience and lower cost. Patients and physicians can receive the scanned images on their mobile phones at any time via a wireless network with low latency. However, it is difficult for portable ultrasound devices to capture images with the same quality as standard hospital ultrasound image acquisition systems. Usually, the images captured by portable ultrasound equipment have considerable noise. This noise undoubtedly affects the diagnosis of the physician. It is imperative to develop methods to remove the noise while preserving important information in the image. For this reason, we propose a novel denoising neural network model, called Feature-guided Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (FDCNN), to remove noise while retaining important feature information. In order to achieve high-quality denoising results, we employ a hierarchical denoising framework driven by a feature masking layer for medical images. Furthermore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for medical images. Experimental results show that our medical image feature extraction method outperforms previous methods. Combined with the new denoising neural network architecture, portable ultrasound devices can now achieve better diagnostic performance.","2021","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","28272-28281","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\52X4ZL7R\Dong et al. - 2021 - Feature-Guided CNN for Denoising Images From Porta.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\HZ8U6FUV\9353537.html","","","Medical diagnostic imaging; Feature extraction; Image edge detection; Ultrasonic imaging; Anisotropic magnetoresistance; Backpropagation; Biomedical image processing; feature extraction; image denoising; image fusion; Noise reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In profoundly affected or limited resource areas, CXR imaging is preferable owing to its availability, low cost, and rapid results. However, given the rapidly spreading nature of COVID-19, such tests could limit the efficiency of pandemic control and prevention. In response to this issue, artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning are promising options for automatic diagnosis because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the analysis of visual information and a wide range of medical images. This paper reviews and critically assesses the preprint and published reports between March and May 2020 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 via CXR images using convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures.

Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in the accurate extraction of Cobb angle measurements, which is the gold standard for a scoliosis assessment. Such deep learning methods directly estimate the Cobb angle without providing structural information of the spine which can be used for diagnosis. Although conventional segmentation-based methods can provide the spine structure, they still have limitations in the accurate measurement of the Cobb angle. It would be desirable to build a clinician-friendly diagnostic system for scoliosis that provides not only an automated Cobb angle assessment but also local and global structural information of the spine. This paper addresses this need through the development of a hierarchical method which consisting of three major parts. (1) A confidence map is used to selectively localize and identify all vertebrae in an accurate and robust manner, (2) vertebral-tilt field is used to estimate the slope of an individual vertebra, and (3) the Cobb angle is determined by combining the vertebral centroids with the previously obtained vertebral-tilt field. The performance of the proposed method was validated, resulting in circular mean absolute error of 3.51° and symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 7.84% for the Cobb angle.","2020","2021-06-04 18:42:49","2021-06-04 18:42:49","","84618-84630","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GX63PEGY\Kim et al. - 2020 - Automation of Spine Curve Assessment in Frontal Ra.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\7S2EY5EL\9085337.html","","","Deep learning; Feature extraction; Diagnostic radiography; Visualization; deep learning; Estimation; Automation; Cobb angle; Frontal radiographs; scoliosis; spine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
