"AN5EW29U","journalArticle","2020","Sun, Kyung Ho; Huh, Hyunsuk; Tama, Bayu Adhi; Lee, Soo Young; Jung, Joon Ha; Lee, Seungchul","A A Vision-Based Fault Diagnostics Using Explainable Deep Learning With Class Activation Maps","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009852","","In the era of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) and the Internet of Things (IoT), real-time data is enormously collected and analyzed from mechanical equipment. By classifying and characterizing the measured signals, the fault condition of mechanical components could be identified. However, most current health monitoring techniques utilize time-consuming and labor-intensive feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection, that are carried out by experts. This paper, on the contrary, deals with an automatic diagnosis method of machine monitoring using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with class activation maps (CAM). A class activation map enables us to discriminate the fault region in the images, thus allowing us to localize the fault precisely. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how CNN and CAM could be employed to real-world vibration video to characterize the machine's status, representing normal or fault conditions. The performance of the proposed model is validated with a base-excited cantilever beam dataset and a water pump dataset. This paper presents a novel industrial application by developing a promising method for automatic machine condition-based monitoring.","2020","2021-06-04 18:30:41","2021-06-15 11:01:34","","129169-129179","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\XYHL3EB7\Sun et al. - 2020 - Vision-Based Fault Diagnostics Using Explainable D.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BAVPVXJI\9142228.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Artificial neural networks; class activation maps; Convolutional neural network; discriminative region; explainable AI; fault detection; Fault diagnosis; mechanical component; Mechanical sensors; Vibrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the virus begun to spread, emergency departments were busy with COVID-19 patients for whom a quick decision regarding in- or outpatient care was required. The virus can cause characteristic abnormalities in chest radiographs (CXR), but, due to the low sensitivity of CXR, additional variables and criteria are needed to accurately predict risk. Here, we describe a computerized system primarily aimed at extracting the most relevant radiological, clinical, and laboratory variables for improving patient risk prediction, and secondarily at presenting an explainable machine learning system, which may provide simple decision criteria to be used by clinicians as a support for assessing patient risk. To achieve robust and reliable variable selection, Boruta and Random Forest (RF) are combined in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme to produce a variable importance estimate not biased by the presence of surrogates. The most important variables are then selected to train a RF classifier, whose rules may be extracted, simplified, and pruned to finally build an associative tree, particularly appealing for its simplicity. Results show that the radiological score automatically computed through a neural network is highly correlated with the score computed by radiologists, and that laboratory variables, together with the number of comorbidities, aid risk prediction. The prediction performance of our approach was compared to that that of generalized linear models and shown to be effective and robust. The proposed machine learning-based computational system can be easily deployed and used in emergency departments for rapid and accurate risk prediction in COVID-19 patients.","2020","2021-06-04 18:30:41","2021-06-04 18:30:41","","196299-196325","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\B76IDCEX\Casiraghi et al. - 2020 - Explainable Machine Learning for Early Assessment .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\SD3PGVJL\9239931.html","","","Computational modeling; Data models; Feature extraction; COVID-19; Machine learning; Predictive models; Associative tree; Boruta feature selection; clinical data analysis; generalized linear models; missing data imputation; Radio frequency; random forest classifier; risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
