The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural network's prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions. As a result of this research, 3,494,516 people were identified as being at risk of developing CKD in Colombia, or 7% of the total population.","2019","2021-06-04 18:38:37","2021-06-04 18:38:37","","152900-152910","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\74BQQRCD\Vásquez-Morales et al. - 2019 - Explainable Prediction of Chronic Renal Disease in.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\SA9PM5E4\8877828.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Data models; Diseases; Training; explainable AI; Biological neural networks; case-based reasoning; Chronic kidney disease prediction; neural networks; random forest; Sociology; support vector machines; twin systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
