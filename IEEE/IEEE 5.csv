With the emergence of Kubernetes, the management of applications inside containers (or pods) is simplified. Kubernetes allows automated actions like self-healing, scaling, rolling back, and updates for the application management. At the same time, security threats have also evolved with attacks on pods to perform malicious actions. Out of several recent malware types, cryptomining has emerged as one of the most serious threats with its hijacking of server resources for cryptocurrency mining. During application deployment and execution in the pod, a cryptomining process, started by a hidden malware executable can be run in the background, and a method to detect malicious cryptomining software running inside Kubernetes pods is needed. One feasible strategy is to use machine learning (ML) to identify and classify pods based on whether or not they contain a running process of cryptomining. In addition to such detection, the system administrator will need an explanation as to the reason(s) of the ML's classification outcome. The explanation will justify and support disruptive administrative decisions such as pod removal or its restart with a new image. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of an ML-based detection system of anomalous pods in a Kubernetes cluster by monitoring Linux-kernel system calls (syscalls). Several types of cryptominers images are used as containers within an anomalous pod, and several ML models are built to detect such pods in the presence of numerous healthy cloud workloads. Explainability is provided using SHAP, LIME, and a novel auto-encoding-based scheme for LSTM models. Seven evaluation metrics are used to compare and contrast the explainable models of the proposed ML cryptomining detection engine.","2021-03","2021-06-04 18:23:15","2021-06-04 18:23:15","","674-691","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\RYJQPL25\Karn et al. - 2021 - Cryptomining Detection in Container Clouds Using S.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\5ZLJWLYS\9215018.html","","","explainability; machine learning; Machine learning; Data mining; anomaly; Cloud computing; containers; Containers; Cryptocurrency; Cryptomining; docker; kubernetes; Malware; pod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first stage involves segmenting the phonocardiogram to detect fundamental heart sounds; after which features are extracted and classification is performed. Some researchers in the field argue the segmentation step is an unwanted computational burden, whereas others embrace it as a prior step to feature extraction. When comparing accuracies achieved by studies that have segmented heart sounds before analysis with those who have overlooked that step, the question of whether to segment heart sounds before feature extraction is still open. In this study, we explicitly examine the importance of heart sound segmentation as a prior step for heart sound classification, and then seek to apply the obtained insights to propose a robust classifier for abnormal heart sound detection. Furthermore, recognizing the pressing need for explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the medical domain, we also unveil hidden representations learned by the classifier using model interpretation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the segmentation which can be learned by the model plays an essential role in abnormal heart sound classification. Our new classifier is also shown to be robust, stable and most importantly, explainable, with an accuracy of almost 100% on the widely used PhysioNet dataset.","2021-06","2021-06-04 18:23:15","2021-06-04 18:23:15","","2162-2171","","6","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GG5BJWUW\9210180.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\ARL8V62S\Dissanayake et al. - 2021 - A Robust Interpretable Deep Learning Classifier fo.pdf","","","Biological system modeling; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Predictive models; neural networks; Robustness; Biomedical signal processing; Heart; heart sound segmentation; phonocardiogram; Phonocardiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wireless spectrum anomalies can take a wide range of forms from the presence of an unwanted signal in a licensed band to the absence of an expected signal, which makes manual labeling of anomalies difficult and suboptimal. We present, spectrum anomaly detector with interpretable features (SAIFE), an adversarial autoencoder (AAE)-based anomaly detector for wireless spectrum anomaly detection using power spectral density (PSD) data. This model achieves an average anomaly detection accuracy above 80% at a constant false alarm rate of 1% along with anomaly localization in an unsupervised setting. In addition, we investigate the model's capabilities to learn interpretable features, such as signal bandwidth, class, and center frequency in a semi-supervised fashion. Along with anomaly detection the model exhibits promising results for lossy PSD data compression up to 120× and semi-supervised signal classification accuracy close to 100% on three datasets just using 20% labeled samples. Finally, the model is tested on data from one of the distributed electrosense sensors over a long term of 500 h showing its anomaly detection capabilities.","2019-09","2021-06-04 18:23:15","2021-06-15 11:01:12","","637-647","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\3IFS7DHX\8692627.html","","","Deep learning; Data models; Feature extraction; Hidden Markov models; Anomaly detection; anomaly detection; Detectors; spectrum monitoring; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
