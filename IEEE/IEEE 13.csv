Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.","2020","2021-06-04 18:54:25","2021-06-04 18:54:25","","97064-97071","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2D5BGW2K\Wang et al. - 2020 - Integrating Co-Clustering and Interpretable Machin.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\QBZPQB7T\9097874.html","","","Data models; Diseases; Medical diagnostic imaging; Machine learning; Predictive models; Data mining; Co-clustering; Immune system; interpretable machine learning; Kawasaki disease; medical informatics; predictive models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2SQ29XV2","journalArticle","2021","Jiang, Shancheng; Li, Huichuan; Jin, Zhi","A Visually Interpretable Deep Learning Framework for Histopathological Image-Based Skin Cancer Diagnosis","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","2168-2208","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3052044","","Owing to the high incidence rate and the severe impact of skin cancer, the precise diagnosis of malignant skin tumors is a significant goal, especially considering treatment is normally effective if the tumor is detected early. Limited published histopathological image sets and the lack of an intuitive correspondence between the features of lesion areas and a certain type of skin cancer pose a challenge to the establishment of high-quality and interpretable computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. To solve this problem, a light-weight attention mechanism-based deep learning framework, namely, DRANet, is proposed to differentiate 11 types of skin diseases based on a real histopathological image set collected by us during the last 10 years. The CAD system can output not only the name of a certain disease but also a visualized diagnostic report showing possible areas related to the disease. The experimental results demonstrate that the DRANet obtains significantly better performance than baseline models (i.e., InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19) with comparable parameter size and competitive accuracy with fewer model parameters. Visualized results produced by the hidden layers of the DRANet actually highlight part of the class-specific regions of diagnostic points and are valuable for decision making in the diagnosis of skin diseases.","2021-05","2021-06-04 18:54:25","2021-06-04 18:54:25","","1483-1494","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\9934BZLI\9325524.html","","","Solid modeling; Deep learning; Diseases; Attention mechanism; computer-aided diagnostic system; Lesions; model visualization; Skin; Skin cancer; skin histopathological image; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
