First, vibration signals are transformed into images by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A CNN is applied as classification model, and Gradient class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is utilized to generate the attention of model. By analyzing the attentions, the explanation of classification models for vibration signals analysis can be carried out. Finally, the verifications of attention are introduced by neural networks, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision trees to demonstrate the proposed results. By the proposed methodology, the explanation of model using highlighted attentions is carried out.","2020","2021-06-04 18:32:21","2021-06-15 11:02:14","","134246-134256","","","8","","","Vibration Signals Analysis by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Approach","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\Y7BFJKL3\Chen and Lee - 2020 - Vibration Signals Analysis by Explainable Artifici.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\AQHJ9MPE\9131692.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Convolutional neural network; explainable AI; Fault diagnosis; Vibrations; fault diagnosis; Frequency-domain analysis; Contracts; Signal analysis; vibration signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By classifying and characterizing the measured signals, the fault condition of mechanical components could be identified. However, most current health monitoring techniques utilize time-consuming and labor-intensive feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection, that are carried out by experts. This paper, on the contrary, deals with an automatic diagnosis method of machine monitoring using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with class activation maps (CAM). A class activation map enables us to discriminate the fault region in the images, thus allowing us to localize the fault precisely. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how CNN and CAM could be employed to real-world vibration video to characterize the machine's status, representing normal or fault conditions. The performance of the proposed model is validated with a base-excited cantilever beam dataset and a water pump dataset. This paper presents a novel industrial application by developing a promising method for automatic machine condition-based monitoring.","2020","2021-06-04 18:32:21","2021-06-15 11:02:19","","129169-129179","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\8D9TN99Z\Sun et al. - 2020 - Vision-Based Fault Diagnostics Using Explainable D.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\MKQS7IRW\9142228.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Artificial neural networks; class activation maps; Convolutional neural network; discriminative region; explainable AI; fault detection; Fault diagnosis; mechanical component; Mechanical sensors; Vibrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"WN9AEHTA","journalArticle","2020","Ibrahim, Lujain; Mesinovic, Munib; Yang, Kai-Wen; Eid, Mohamad A.","Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarction Using Machine Learning and Shapley Values","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040166","","The early and accurate detection of the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is imperative for the timely provision of medical intervention and the reduction of its mortality rate. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in aiding disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a framework to predict the onset of AMI using 713,447 extracted ECG samples and associated auxiliary data from the longitudinal and comprehensive ECG-ViEW II database, previously unexplored in the field of machine learning in healthcare. The framework is realized with two deep learning models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a decision-tree based model, XGBoost. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was utilized to address class imbalance. High prediction accuracy of 89.9%, 84.6%, 97.5% and ROC curve areas of 90.7%, 82.9%, 96.5% have been achieved for the best CNN, RNN, and XGBoost models, respectively. Shapley values were utilized to identify the features that contributed most to the classification decision with XGBoost, demonstrating the high impact of auxiliary inputs such as age and sex. This paper demonstrates the promising application of explainable machine learning in the field of cardiovascular disease prediction.","2020","2021-06-04 18:32:21","2021-06-04 18:32:21","","210410-210417","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\7XNDWYQ8\Ibrahim et al. - 2020 - Explainable Prediction of Acute Myocardial Infarct.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\TJQSYTLQ\9268965.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Predictive models; Training; Databases; predictive models; acute myocardial infarction; biomedical informatics; Electrocardiography; Myocardium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
