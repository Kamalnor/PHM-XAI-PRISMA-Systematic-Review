In this paper, a novel clinical interpretable ConvNet architecture is proposed not only for accurate glaucoma diagnosis but also for the more transparent interpretation by highlighting the distinct regions recognised by the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of providing the interpretable diagnosis of glaucoma with the popular deep learning model. We propose a novel scheme for aggregating features from different scales to promote the performance of glaucoma diagnosis, which we refer to as M-LAP. Moreover, by modelling the correspondence from binary diagnosis information to the spatial pixels, the proposed scheme generates glaucoma activations, which bridge the gap between global semantical diagnosis and precise location. In contrast to previous works, it can discover the distinguish local regions in fundus images as evidence for clinical interpretable glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results, performed on the challenging ORIGA datasets, show that our method on glaucoma diagnosis outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the highest AUC (0.88). Remarkably, the extensive results, optic disc segmentation (dice of 0.9) and local disease focus localization based on the evidence map, demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on clinical interpretability.","2020-05","2021-06-04 18:57:44","2021-06-04 18:57:44","","1405-1412","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\P2K5NY6L\8880490.html","","","Feature extraction; Lesions; Semantics; Convolution; Biomedical optical imaging; clinical interpreta-tion; Computer architecture; Glaucoma diagnosis; medical image processing; Optical imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, vibration signals are transformed into images by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A CNN is applied as classification model, and Gradient class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is utilized to generate the attention of model. By analyzing the attentions, the explanation of classification models for vibration signals analysis can be carried out. Finally, the verifications of attention are introduced by neural networks, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision trees to demonstrate the proposed results. By the proposed methodology, the explanation of model using highlighted attentions is carried out.","2020","2021-06-04 18:57:44","2021-06-15 11:04:34","","134246-134256","","","8","","","Vibration Signals Analysis by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Approach","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\S86CRSZQ\Chen and Lee - 2020 - Vibration Signals Analysis by Explainable Artifici.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\MVQN87XQ\9131692.html","","","Feature extraction; Machine learning; Convolutional neural network; explainable AI; Fault diagnosis; Vibrations; fault diagnosis; Frequency-domain analysis; Contracts; Signal analysis; vibration signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DABRFVLP","journalArticle","2020","Abid, Firas Ben; Sallem, Marwen; Braham, Ahmed","A A Robust Interpretable Deep Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors","IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","1557-9662","10.1109/TIM.2019.2932162","","In modern manufacturing processes, motivations for automatic fault diagnosis (FD) are increasingly growing as a result of the great trends toward achieving zero breakdowns. Induction motors (IMs) represent a critical part in most of the applications. Due to its high potential of automatic feature extraction, the deep learning (DL)-based FD of IM has recently been introduced and has essentially emphasized on the diagnosis using the vibration analysis. However, this approach has not received considerable attention when using the current analysis, although it represents a cost-effective alternative. Moreover, the already implemented DL architectures are still suffering from lack of physical interpretability. In this article, a new DL architecture called deep-SincNet is implemented for a multi-FD task. The proposed end-to-end scheme automatically learns the fault features from the raw motor current and accordingly finalizes the FD process. A high accuracy for several separated and combined faults, a more physical interpretability, a high robustness against noisy environments, and a significant gain in implementation cost prove the competitive performance of the proposed approach.","2020-06","2021-06-04 18:57:44","2021-06-15 11:04:30","","3506-3515","","6","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\VQ2ZJT66\8782837.html","","","Feature extraction; Convolution; convolutional neural network (CNN); Induction motors; Bars; Bearing fault; broken rotor bar; combined faults; condition monitoring; current analysis; deep learning (DL); Digital filters; Filter banks; induction motor (IM); Rotors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
