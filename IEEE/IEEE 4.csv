With the increasing number of people infected, healthcare systems, especially those in developing countries, are bearing tremendous pressure. There is an urgent need for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the prognosis of inpatients. To alleviate these problems, a data-driven medical assistance system is put forward in this paper. Based on two real-world datasets in Wuhan, China, the proposed system integrates data from different sources with tools of machine learning (ML) to predict COVID-19 infected probability of suspected patients in their first visit, and then predict mortality of confirmed cases. Rather than choosing an interpretable algorithm, this system separates the explanations from machine learning models. It can do help to patient triaging and provide some useful advice for doctors.","2020","2021-06-04 18:21:43","2021-06-04 18:21:43","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BFLCAI5W\Lu et al. - 2020 - An Explainable System for Diagnosis and Prognosis .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\X543AGQ8\9259025.html","","","Medical diagnostic imaging; COVID-19; Predictive models; Diagnosis; Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Mathematical model; Monitoring; Prognosis.; Prognostics and health management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"I8WDARJC","journalArticle","2019","Vásquez-Morales, Gabriel R.; Martínez-Monterrubio, Sergio M.; Moreno-Ger, Pablo; Recio-García, Juan A.","Explainable Prediction of Chronic Renal Disease in the Colombian Population Using Neural Networks and Case-Based Reasoning","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948430","","This paper presents a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a person is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural network's prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions. As a result of this research, 3,494,516 people were identified as being at risk of developing CKD in Colombia, or 7% of the total population.","2019","2021-06-04 18:21:43","2021-06-04 18:21:43","","152900-152910","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\EIPF93BD\Vásquez-Morales et al. - 2019 - Explainable Prediction of Chronic Renal Disease in.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2ISDDLL7\8877828.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Data models; Diseases; Training; explainable AI; Biological neural networks; case-based reasoning; Chronic kidney disease prediction; neural networks; random forest; Sociology; support vector machines; twin systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
