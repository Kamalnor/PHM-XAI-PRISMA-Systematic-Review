Limited published histopathological image sets and the lack of an intuitive correspondence between the features of lesion areas and a certain type of skin cancer pose a challenge to the establishment of high-quality and interpretable computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. To solve this problem, a light-weight attention mechanism-based deep learning framework, namely, DRANet, is proposed to differentiate 11 types of skin diseases based on a real histopathological image set collected by us during the last 10 years. The CAD system can output not only the name of a certain disease but also a visualized diagnostic report showing possible areas related to the disease. The experimental results demonstrate that the DRANet obtains significantly better performance than baseline models (i.e., InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19) with comparable parameter size and competitive accuracy with fewer model parameters. Visualized results produced by the hidden layers of the DRANet actually highlight part of the class-specific regions of diagnostic points and are valuable for decision making in the diagnosis of skin diseases.","2021-05","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","1483-1494","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\B9EG8U7C\9325524.html","","","Solid modeling; Deep learning; Diseases; Attention mechanism; computer-aided diagnostic system; Lesions; model visualization; Skin; Skin cancer; skin histopathological image; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many Governments have been collecting medical data about their own population with the purpose of using artificial intelligence methods for making those predictions. The most accurate ones are based on so called black-box methods which give little or no information about why they make a certain prediction. However, in the medical field the explanations are sometimes more important than the accuracy since they allow specialists to gain insight about the factors that influence the risk level. It is also frequent to find medical information records with some missing data. In this work, we present the development of a prediction method which not only outperforms some other existing ones but it also gives information about the most probable causes of a high stroke risk and can deal with incomplete data records. It is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of plausibility. For the testing we used data provided by the regional hospital in Okayama, Japan, a country in which people are compelled to undergo annual health checkups by law. This article presents experiments comparing the results of the Dempster-Shafer method with the ones obtained using other well-known machine learning methods like Multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes. Our approach performed the best in these experiments with some missing data. It also presents an analysis of the interpretation of rules produced by the method for doing the classification. The rules were validated by both medical literature and human specialists.","2021","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","1154-1166","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\IADPXEME\Peñafiel et al. - 2021 - Predicting Stroke Risk With an Interpretable Class.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\94BJWLZ9\9306826.html","","","Computational modeling; Bayes methods; Data models; Medical diagnostic imaging; Dempster-Shafer theory; expert systems; interpretable classification; Machine learning; Predictive models; stroke; Stroke (medical condition)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they are still challenged by complicated conditions where the segmentation target has large variations of position, shape and scale, and existing CNNs have a poor explainability that limits their application to clinical decisions. In this work, we make extensive use of multiple attentions in a CNN architecture and propose a comprehensive attention-based CNN (CA-Net) for more accurate and explainable medical image segmentation that is aware of the most important spatial positions, channels and scales at the same time. In particular, we first propose a joint spatial attention module to make the network focus more on the foreground region. Then, a novel channel attention module is proposed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses and highlight the most relevant feature channels. Also, we propose a scale attention module implicitly emphasizing the most salient feature maps among multiple scales so that the CNN is adaptive to the size of an object. Extensive experiments on skin lesion segmentation from ISIC 2018 and multi-class segmentation of fetal MRI found that our proposed CA-Net significantly improved the average segmentation Dice score from 87.77% to 92.08% for skin lesion, 84.79% to 87.08% for the placenta and 93.20% to 95.88% for the fetal brain respectively compared with U-Net. It reduced the model size to around 15 times smaller with close or even better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art DeepLabv3+. In addition, it has a much higher explainability than existing networks by visualizing the attention weight maps.

There is an urgent need for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the prognosis of inpatients. To alleviate these problems, a data-driven medical assistance system is put forward in this paper. Based on two real-world datasets in Wuhan, China, the proposed system integrates data from different sources with tools of machine learning (ML) to predict COVID-19 infected probability of suspected patients in their first visit, and then predict mortality of confirmed cases.

Since the virus begun to spread, emergency departments were busy with COVID-19 patients for whom a quick decision regarding in- or outpatient care was required. The virus can cause characteristic abnormalities in chest radiographs (CXR), but, due to the low sensitivity of CXR, additional variables and criteria are needed to accurately predict risk. Here, we describe a computerized system primarily aimed at extracting the most relevant radiological, clinical, and laboratory variables for improving patient risk prediction, and secondarily at presenting an explainable machine learning system, which may provide simple decision criteria to be used by clinicians as a support for assessing patient risk. To achieve robust and reliable variable selection, Boruta and Random Forest (RF) are combined in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme to produce a variable importance estimate not biased by the presence of surrogates. The most important variables are then selected to train a RF classifier, whose rules may be extracted, simplified, and pruned to finally build an associative tree, particularly appealing for its simplicity. Results show that the radiological score automatically computed through a neural network is highly correlated with the score computed by radiologists, and that laboratory variables, together with the number of comorbidities, aid risk prediction. The prediction performance of our approach was compared to that that of generalized linear models and shown to be effective and robust. The proposed machine learning-based computational system can be easily deployed and used in emergency departments for rapid and accurate risk prediction in COVID-19 patients.","2020","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","196299-196325","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\SKXL6N9N\Casiraghi et al. - 2020 - Explainable Machine Learning for Early Assessment .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\DISDWSS4\9239931.html","","","Computational modeling; Data models; Feature extraction; COVID-19; Machine learning; Predictive models; Associative tree; Boruta feature selection; clinical data analysis; generalized linear models; missing data imputation; Radio frequency; random forest classifier; risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Search and retrieval methods are specifically important as they assist physicians in making the right diagnosis in medical imaging owing to their ability of obtaining similar cases for a query image. Supervised classification algorithms are generally more accurate than unsupervised search-based classifications; however, the latter may more easily provide insights into the decision-making process by providing a group of similar cases and their corresponding metadata (i.e., diagnostic reports) and not simply a class probability. In this study, we propose a class-aware search operating on deep image embeddings to increase the accuracy of content-based search. We validate our methodology using two different publicly available datasets, one containing endometrial cancer images and the other containing colorectal cancer images. The proposed class-aware scenarios can enhance the accuracy of the search-based classifier, thereby making them more feasible in practice. With search results providing access to the metadata of retrieved cases (i.e., pathology reports of evidently diagnosed cases), such a combination has clear benefits for assisting experts with explainable results.","2020","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","197352-197362","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\DTI78ZLI\Ebrahimian et al. - 2020 - Class-Aware Image Search for Interpretable Cancer .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\393QJP6A\9238034.html","","","Medical diagnostic imaging; Feature extraction; Cancer; deep learning; medical image classification; Medical image search; Metadata; Pathology; pathology whole-slide images; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performing diagnosis prediction from the irregular medical time series is challenging because the intervals between consecutive records significantly vary along time. Existing methods often handle this problem by generating regular time series from the irregular medical records without considering the uncertainty in the generated data, induced by the varying intervals. Thus, a novel Uncertainty-Aware Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (UA-CRNN) is proposed in this article, which introduces the uncertainty information in the generated data to boost the risk prediction. To tackle the complex medical time series with subseries of different frequencies, the uncertainty information is further incorporated into the subseries level rather than the whole sequence to seamlessly adjust different time intervals. Specifically, a hierarchical uncertainty-aware decomposition layer (UADL) is designed to adaptively decompose time series into different subseries and assign them proper weights in accordance with their reliabilities. Meanwhile, an Explainable UA-CRNN (eUA-CRNN) is proposed to exploit filters with different passbands to ensure the unity of components in each subseries and the diversity of components in different subseries. Furthermore, eUA-CRNN incorporates with an uncertainty-aware attention module to learn attention weights from the uncertainty information, providing the explainable prediction results. The extensive experimental results on three real-world medical data sets illustrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","2020","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","1-15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\YN6U47GR\9224838.html","","","Task analysis; Medical diagnostic imaging; Machine learning; Attention module; convolutional recurrent neural network; explainable risk prediction results; Reliability; Time series analysis; time-series decomposition; Uncertainty; uncertainty-aware prediction.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A class activation map enables us to discriminate the fault region in the images, thus allowing us to localize the fault precisely. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how CNN and CAM could be employed to real-world vibration video to characterize the machine's status, representing normal or fault conditions.

Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.","2020","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","97064-97071","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\78N2I3GJ\Wang et al. - 2020 - Integrating Co-Clustering and Interpretable Machin.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\R4PERP62\9097874.html","","","Data models; Diseases; Medical diagnostic imaging; Machine learning; Predictive models; Data mining; Co-clustering; Immune system; interpretable machine learning; Kawasaki disease; medical informatics; predictive models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a visually interpretable network (VINet) which can generate diagnostic visual interpretations while making accurate diagnoses. VINet is an end-to-end model consisting of an importance estimation network and a classification network. The former produces a diagnostic visual interpretation for each case, and the classifier diagnoses the case. In the classifier, by exploring the information in the diagnostic visual interpretation, the irrelevant information in the feature maps is eliminated by our proposed feature destruction process. This allows the classification network to concentrate on the important features and use them as the primary references for classification. Through a joint optimization of higher classification accuracy and eliminating as many irrelevant features as possible, a precise, fine-grained diagnostic visual interpretation, along with an accurate diagnosis, can be produced by our proposed network simultaneously.

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results. Experiments demonstrate that COAM can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction and provide clinically meaningful explanations.","2019","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","134236-134244","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BB8MX89F\Guo et al. - 2019 - An Interpretable Disease Onset Predictive Model Us.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\NZPWLTZY\8761846.html","","","Deep learning; Diseases; Medical diagnostic imaging; Predictive models; Data mining; attention mechanism; Healthcare informatics; recurrent neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; separation of medical information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to disease grading via the discovered deep radiomic sequencer, the CLEAR-DR system also produces a visual interpretation of the decision-making process to provide better insight and understanding of the decision-making process of the system.

Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.","2020-06","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","2088-2099","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\LHS3GDCJ\8950467.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\TIGWTQCR\Biffi et al. - 2020 - Explainable Anatomical Shape Analysis Through Deep.pdf","","","Task analysis; Deep learning; Shape; Three-dimensional displays; Medical diagnostic imaging; Pathology; explainable deep learning; generative modeling; MRI; Shape analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.","2019-01","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","299-309","","1","25","","","RetainVis","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\XZGHSJ5B\8440842.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\5I3C8STC\Kwon et al. - 2019 - RetainVis Visual Analytics with Interpretable and.pdf","","","Computational modeling; Task analysis; Data models; Medical diagnostic imaging; Machine learning; Predictive models; Healthcare; Interactive Artificial Intelligence; Interpretable Deep Learning; Visual analytics; XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS. The designed system considers the ontology semantic similarity of diabetes complications and symptoms concepts in the fuzzy rules' evaluation process. The framework was tested using a real data set, and the results indicate how the proposed system helps physicians and patients to accurately diagnose diabetes mellitus.","2018","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","37371-37394","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\8JC2Z9RG\El-Sappagh et al. - 2018 - An Ontology-Based Interpretable Fuzzy Decision Sup.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\6CMXFT8Z\8403911.html","","","Diseases; Medical diagnostic imaging; Diabetes; Clinical decision support system; Cognition; diabetes diagnosis; fuzzy inference system; fuzzy interpretability; Ontologies; ontology reasoning; Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The correlation structure may also change as a function of other cofactors, for example, the identity of the subject in biomedical data. A fundamental approach for the analysis of such data is to estimate the correlation structure (connectivities) separately in short time windows or for different subjects and use existing machine learning methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to summarize or visualize the changes in connectivity. However, the visualization of such a straightforward PCA is problematic because the ensuing connectivity patterns are much more complex objects than, say, spatial patterns. Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing variability in connectivities using the PCA approach as the starting point. First, we show how to analyze and visualize the principal components of connectivity matrices by a tailor-made rank-two matrix approximation in which we use the outer product of two orthogonal vectors. This leads to a new kind of transformation of eigenvectors that is particularly suited for this purpose and often enables interpretation of the principal component as connectivity between two groups of variables. Second, we show how to incorporate the orthogonality and the rank-two constraint in the estimation of PCA itself to improve the results. We further provide an interpretation of these methods in terms of estimation of a probabilistic generative model related to blind separation of dependent sources. Experiments on brain imaging data give very promising results.","2016-03","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","445-484","","3","28","","","Orthogonal Connectivity Factorization","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: Neural Computation","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\KS8VXQLD\7412850.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with most of the existing intelligence models, fuzzy systems have shown a distinctive advantage in their interpretabilities. However, how to determine the model reliability of a fuzzy system trained for a recognition task is still an unsolved problem at present. In this study, a minimax probability Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system classifier called MP-TSK-FSC is proposed to train a fuzzy system classifier and determine the model reliability simultaneously. For the proposed MP-TSK-FSC, a lower bound of correct classification can be presented to the users to characterize the reliability of the trained fuzzy classifier. Thus, the obtained classifier has the distinctive characteristics of both a high level of interpretability and transparent model reliability inherited from the fuzzy system and minimax probability learning strategy, respectively. Our experiments on synthetic datasets and several real-world datasets for medical diagnosis have confirmed the distinctive characteristics of the proposed method.","2015-08","2021-06-04 18:15:39","2021-06-04 18:15:39","","813-826","","4","23","","","Minimax Probability TSK Fuzzy System Classifier","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\VLI9BBHJ\6824841.html","","","Reliability; Classification; Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy systems; medical diagnosis; Medical diagnosis; minimax probability decision; Optimization; Partitioning algorithms; Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy system; Training data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
