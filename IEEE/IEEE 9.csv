The crux of the problem is that these models should be explainable the model should give doctors rationales that can explain the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a visually interpretable network (VINet) which can generate diagnostic visual interpretations while making accurate diagnoses. VINet is an end-to-end model consisting of an importance estimation network and a classification network. The former produces a diagnostic visual interpretation for each case, and the classifier diagnoses the case. In the classifier, by exploring the information in the diagnostic visual interpretation, the irrelevant information in the feature maps is eliminated by our proposed feature destruction process. This allows the classification network to concentrate on the important features and use them as the primary references for classification. Through a joint optimization of higher classification accuracy and eliminating as many irrelevant features as possible, a precise, fine-grained diagnostic visual interpretation, along with an accurate diagnosis, can be produced by our proposed network simultaneously. Based on a computed tomography image dataset (LUNA16) on pulmonary nodule, extensive experiments have been conducted, demonstrating that the proposed VINet can produce state-of-the-art diagnostic visual interpretations compared with all baseline methods.","2020-07","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-04 18:40:38","","1720-1729","","7","22","","","VINet","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\AUUUH7Z5\8979157.html","","","Computational modeling; Solid modeling; Task analysis; Biomedical imaging; Medical services; Visualization; Machine learning; Estimation; image classification; medical diagnostic imaging; neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AB7CP274","journalArticle","2020","Kim, Kang Cheol; Yun, Hye Sun; Kim, Sungjun; Seo, Jin Keun","Automation of Spine Curve Assessment in Frontal Radiographs Using Deep Learning of Vertebral-Tilt Vector","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992081","","In this paper, an automated and visually explainable system is proposed for a scoliosis assessment from spinal radiographs, which deals with the drawback of manual measurements, which are known to be time-consuming, cumbersome, and operator dependent. Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in the accurate extraction of Cobb angle measurements, which is the gold standard for a scoliosis assessment. Such deep learning methods directly estimate the Cobb angle without providing structural information of the spine which can be used for diagnosis. Although conventional segmentation-based methods can provide the spine structure, they still have limitations in the accurate measurement of the Cobb angle. It would be desirable to build a clinician-friendly diagnostic system for scoliosis that provides not only an automated Cobb angle assessment but also local and global structural information of the spine. This paper addresses this need through the development of a hierarchical method which consisting of three major parts. (1) A confidence map is used to selectively localize and identify all vertebrae in an accurate and robust manner, (2) vertebral-tilt field is used to estimate the slope of an individual vertebra, and (3) the Cobb angle is determined by combining the vertebral centroids with the previously obtained vertebral-tilt field. The performance of the proposed method was validated, resulting in circular mean absolute error of 3.51° and symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 7.84% for the Cobb angle.","2020","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-04 18:40:38","","84618-84630","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2QL699RP\Kim et al. - 2020 - Automation of Spine Curve Assessment in Frontal Ra.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\9XP78B34\9085337.html","","","Deep learning; Feature extraction; Diagnostic radiography; Visualization; deep learning; Estimation; Automation; Cobb angle; Frontal radiographs; scoliosis; spine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In profoundly affected or limited resource areas, CXR imaging is preferable owing to its availability, low cost, and rapid results. However, given the rapidly spreading nature of COVID-19, such tests could limit the efficiency of pandemic control and prevention. In response to this issue, artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning are promising options for automatic diagnosis because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the analysis of visual information and a wide range of medical images. This paper reviews and critically assesses the preprint and published reports between March and May 2020 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 via CXR images using convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures. Despite the encouraging results, there is an urgent need for public, comprehensive, and diverse datasets. Further investigations in terms of explainable and justifiable decisions are also required for more robust, transparent, and accurate predictions.","2021","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-07 18:11:52","","20235-20254","","","9","","","Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\JJD3ALVA\Alghamdi et al. - 2021 - Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting COVID-19 Fr.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\MKDNW23Z\9335581.html","","","Task analysis; Deep learning; Biomedical imaging; COVID-19; Lung; deep learning; Tools; Chest x-ray; coronavirus; radiological imaging; Radiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the virus begun to spread, emergency departments were busy with COVID-19 patients for whom a quick decision regarding in- or outpatient care was required. The virus can cause characteristic abnormalities in chest radiographs (CXR), but, due to the low sensitivity of CXR, additional variables and criteria are needed to accurately predict risk. Here, we describe a computerized system primarily aimed at extracting the most relevant radiological, clinical, and laboratory variables for improving patient risk prediction, and secondarily at presenting an explainable machine learning system, which may provide simple decision criteria to be used by clinicians as a support for assessing patient risk. To achieve robust and reliable variable selection, Boruta and Random Forest (RF) are combined in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme to produce a variable importance estimate not biased by the presence of surrogates. The most important variables are then selected to train a RF classifier, whose rules may be extracted, simplified, and pruned to finally build an associative tree, particularly appealing for its simplicity. Results show that the radiological score automatically computed through a neural network is highly correlated with the score computed by radiologists, and that laboratory variables, together with the number of comorbidities, aid risk prediction. The prediction performance of our approach was compared to that that of generalized linear models and shown to be effective and robust. The proposed machine learning-based computational system can be easily deployed and used in emergency departments for rapid and accurate risk prediction in COVID-19 patients.","2020","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-04 18:40:38","","196299-196325","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\UWATJKKP\Casiraghi et al. - 2020 - Explainable Machine Learning for Early Assessment .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\KU5UXWHT\9239931.html","","","Computational modeling; Data models; Feature extraction; COVID-19; Machine learning; Predictive models; Associative tree; Boruta feature selection; clinical data analysis; generalized linear models; missing data imputation; Radio frequency; random forest classifier; risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data-driven approaches have the potential to identify the high-risk individuals by capturing the complex patterns of real-world data. To enable clinically applicable prediction of intravenous immunoglobulin resistance addressing the incompleteness of clinical data and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, a multi-stage method is developed by integrating data missing pattern mining and intelligible models. First, co-clustering is adopted to characterize the block-wise data missing patterns by simultaneously grouping the clinical features and patients to enable (a) group-based feature selection and missing data imputation and (b) patient subgroup-specific predictive models considering the availability of data. Second, feature selection is performed using the group Lasso to uncover group-specific risk factors. Third, the Explainable Boosting Machine, which is an interpretable learning method based on generalized additive models, is applied for the prediction of each patient subgroup. The experiments using real-world Electronic Health Records demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework for predictive modeling compared with a set of benchmark methods. This study highlights the integration of co-clustering and supervised learning methods for incomplete clinical data mining, and promotes data-driven approaches to investigate predictors and effective algorithms for decision making in healthcare.","2020","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-04 18:40:38","","97064-97071","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\X8PFLW5G\Wang et al. - 2020 - Integrating Co-Clustering and Interpretable Machin.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\PIRWHC69\9097874.html","","","Data models; Diseases; Medical diagnostic imaging; Machine learning; Predictive models; Data mining; Co-clustering; Immune system; interpretable machine learning; Kawasaki disease; medical informatics; predictive models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, portable ultrasound is being more widely used for its convenience and lower cost. Patients and physicians can receive the scanned images on their mobile phones at any time via a wireless network with low latency. However, it is difficult for portable ultrasound devices to capture images with the same quality as standard hospital ultrasound image acquisition systems. Usually, the images captured by portable ultrasound equipment have considerable noise. This noise undoubtedly affects the diagnosis of the physician. It is imperative to develop methods to remove the noise while preserving important information in the image. For this reason, we propose a novel denoising neural network model, called Feature-guided Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (FDCNN), to remove noise while retaining important feature information. In order to achieve high-quality denoising results, we employ a hierarchical denoising framework driven by a feature masking layer for medical images. Furthermore, we propose a feature extraction algorithm based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for medical images. Experimental results show that our medical image feature extraction method outperforms previous methods. Combined with the new denoising neural network architecture, portable ultrasound devices can now achieve better diagnostic performance.","2021","2021-06-04 18:40:38","2021-06-04 18:40:38","","28272-28281","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\6WKCEQB2\Dong et al. - 2021 - Feature-Guided CNN for Denoising Images From Porta.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\9TZXX5DA\9353537.html","","","Medical diagnostic imaging; Feature extraction; Image edge detection; Ultrasonic imaging; Anisotropic magnetoresistance; Backpropagation; Biomedical image processing; feature extraction; image denoising; image fusion; Noise reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
