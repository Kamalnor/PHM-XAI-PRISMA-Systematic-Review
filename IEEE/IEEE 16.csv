However, an explanation on the physical meaning of a CNN architecture has rarely been studied. In this article, a novel wavelet-driven deep neural network, termed as WaveletKernelNet (WKN), is presented, where a continuous wavelet convolutional (CWConv) layer is designed to replace the first convolutional layer of the standard CNN. This enables the first CWConv layer to discover more meaningful kernels. Furthermore, only the scale parameter and translation parameter are directly learned from raw data at this CWConv layer. This provides a very effective way to obtain a customized kernel bank, specifically tuned for extracting defect-related impact component embedded in the vibration signal. In addition, three experimental studies using data from laboratory environment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mechanical fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the WKNs is higher than CNN by more than 10%, which indicate the importance of the designed CWConv layer. Besides, through theoretical analysis and feature map visualization, it is found that the WKNs are interpretable, have fewer parameters, and have the ability to converge faster within the same training epochs.","2021","2021-06-04 19:03:45","2021-06-15 11:07:37","","1-11","","","","","","WaveletKernelNet","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\3FMIWTQB\9328876.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\NRZ362LT\Li et al. - 2021 - WaveletKernelNet An Interpretable Deep Neural Net.pdf","","","Neural networks; Feature extraction; Prognostics and health management; Fault diagnosis; Kernel; Continuous wavelet convolutional (CWConv) layer; continuous wavelet transform (CWT); Continuous wavelet transforms; Convolution; convolutional neural network (CNN); machine fault diagnosis; prognostic and health management (PHM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since machinery faults are always caused by performance deterioration of components, learning the deteriorating mode from observed sensor data facilitates the prognostics of impeding faults and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL). In modern CPSs, several key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored to detect the corresponding fine-grained deteriorating modes of industrial machines. However, the overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on these KPIs with various patterns have been a great challenge, especially without labels of deteriorating index or uninterpretable of root causes. In this paper, we proposed K-PdM, a cluster-based hidden Markov model for the machinery deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on multiple KPIs. The method uncovers the fine-grained deteriorating modes of machines through each unlabeled KPI data and learns a mapping between each deteriorating KPI index and RULs. Accordingly, an overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction of machine are able to be achieved based on the combination of each KPI's deterioration estimation. Moreover, a set of interpretable semantic rules are setup to analyze the root cause of performance deterioration among KPIs. An experimental application is proposed to demonstrate its applicability based on the PHM08 data sets. The obtained results show their effectiveness to predict the RULs of machines.","2018","2021-06-04 19:03:45","2021-06-15 11:07:22","","41676-41687","","","6","","","K-PdM","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\J4HVTYGS\Wu et al. - 2018 - K-PdM KPI-Oriented Machinery Deterioration Estima.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\33PWPNDD\8421220.html","","","Hidden Markov models; Prognostics and health management; Time series analysis; Estimation; time series analysis; Degradation; hidden Markov models (HMMs); Indexes; Machinery; remaining life assessment; Temperature measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing number of people infected, healthcare systems, especially those in developing countries, are bearing tremendous pressure. There is an urgent need for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the prognosis of inpatients. To alleviate these problems, a data-driven medical assistance system is put forward in this paper. Based on two real-world datasets in Wuhan, China, the proposed system integrates data from different sources with tools of machine learning (ML) to predict COVID-19 infected probability of suspected patients in their first visit, and then predict mortality of confirmed cases. Rather than choosing an interpretable algorithm, this system separates the explanations from machine learning models. It can do help to patient triaging and provide some useful advice for doctors.","2020","2021-06-04 19:03:45","2021-06-04 19:03:45","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\4XRG36DH\Lu et al. - 2020 - An Explainable System for Diagnosis and Prognosis .pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\YWWI6YM6\9259025.html","","","Medical diagnostic imaging; COVID-19; Predictive models; Diagnosis; Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Mathematical model; Monitoring; Prognosis.; Prognostics and health management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most deep learning-based objective outcome prediction and grading paradigms are based on histology or genomics alone and do not make use of the complementary information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for end-to-end multimodal fusion of histology image and genomic (mutations, CNV, RNASeq) features for survival outcome prediction. Our approach models pairwise feature interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker product of unimodal feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gatingbased attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to interpret and saliently localize features across each modality, and understand how feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired wholeslide image, genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth survival and histologic grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion paradigm improves prognostic determinations from ground truth grading and molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks trained on histology and genomic data alone. The proposed method establishes insight and theory on how to train deep networks on multimodal biomedical data in an intuitive manner, which will be useful for other problems in medicine that seek to combine heterogeneous data streams for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.

In order to test the applicability of GBDT, models with different prediction horizons (5 min ahead, 10 min ahead, and 15 min ahead) are established. The 11 variables are viewed as candidates in this paper. Different from other machine learning algorithms as black boxes, GBDT can provide interpretable results through variable importance. In the proposed model, the variable importance shows that for different prediction horizons, the most important influence variable is uniform, which is travel time in the current period. Traffic conditions in the current period have the greatest influence on the predicted travel time. Compared with the back propagation neural network model and the support vector machine model, the proposed GBDT model can produce more accurate prediction results, especially in multi-step prediction, indicating that GBDT is a promising method in travel time prediction.","2019","2021-06-04 19:03:45","2021-06-04 19:03:45","","7466-7480","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2TF28MUY\Cheng et al. - 2019 - Research on Travel Time Prediction Model of Freewa.pdf; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\PDJ29XMF\8576521.html","","","Computational modeling; Data models; machine learning; Predictive models; Mathematical model; Boosting; Decision trees; Different prediction horizons; freeway; gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); traffic flow; travel time prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
