The rolling surface fatigue of frogs along the crossing lifecycle is analysed. The research is based on information from high-resolution optical images of the frog rolling surface and images from magnetic particle inspection. Image processing methods are used to pre-process the images and to detect the feature set that corresponds to objects similar to surface cracks. Machine learning methods are used for the analysis of crack images from the beginning to the end of the crossing lifecycle. Statistically significant crack features and their combinations that depict the surface fatigue state are found. The research result consists of the early prediction of rail contact fatigue.","2019-06-01","2021-06-07 21:18:01","2021-06-07 21:18:01","2021-06-07 21:18:01","123-132","","2","5","","Urban Rail Transit","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\F6HANP3V\Sysyn et al. - 2019 - Prediction of Rail Contact Fatigue on Crossings Us.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
