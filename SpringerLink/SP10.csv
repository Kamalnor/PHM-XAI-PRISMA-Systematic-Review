Meanwhile, technology development has spawned the big data in healthcare rapidly. Nowadays, application of deep learning to solve the problems in healthcare is a hot research direction. This paper introduces the application of deep learning in healthcare extensively. We focus on 7 application areas of deep learning, which are electronic health records (EHR), electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), community healthcare, data from wearable devices, drug analysis and genomics analysis. The scope of this paper does not cover medical image processing since other researchers have already substantially reviewed it. In addition, we analyze the merits and drawbacks of the existing works, analyze the existing challenges, and discuss future trends.","2018-12-01","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:37","643-655","","6","15","","Int.

Characterisation and monitoring of spattering behaviours are highly valuable in understanding the manufacturing process and improving the manufacturing quality of SLM. This paper introduces a method of automatic visual classification to distinguish spattering characteristics of SLM processes in different manufacturing conditions. A compact feature descriptor is proposed to represent spattering patterns and its effectiveness is evaluated using real images captured in different conditions. The feature descriptor of this work combines information of spatter trajectory morphology, spatial distributions, and temporal information. The classification is performed using support vector machine (SVM) and random forests for testing and shows highly promising classification accuracy of about 97%. The advantages of this work include compactness for representation and semantic interpretability with the feature description. In addition, the qualities of manufacturing parts are mapped with spattering characteristics under different laser energy densities. Such a map table can be then used to define the desired spatter features, providing a non-contact monitoring solution for online anomaly detection. This work will lead to a further integration of real-time vision monitoring system for an online closed-loop prognostic system for SLM systems, in order to improve the performance in terms of manufacturing quality, power consumption, and fault detection.","2020-10-01","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:37","2955-2976","","11","110","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\5GQD5BTX\Ji and Han - 2020 - A novel image feature descriptor for SLM spatterin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recoveries work when various different types of anomalies are triggered any number of times at any point in the task, including during already running recoveries. Our recovery critic stands atop of a tightly-integrated, graph-based online motion-generation and introspection system. Policies, skills, and introspection models are learned incrementally and contextually over time. Recoveries are studied via a collaborative kitting task where a wide range of anomalous conditions are experienced in the system.

The core of the CAAI is a cognitive module that processes the user’s declarative goals, selects suitable models and algorithms, and creates a configuration for the execution of a processing pipeline on a big data platform. Constant observation and evaluation against performance criteria assess the performance of pipelines for many and different use cases. Based on these evaluations, the pipelines are automatically adapted if necessary. The modular design with well-defined interfaces enables the reusability and extensibility of pipeline components. A big data platform implements this modular design supported by technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka for virtualization and orchestration of the individual components and their communication. The implementation of the architecture is evaluated using a real-world use case.

During this long operational phase operation requirements and other production conditions change frequently. Accordingly, the plants have to be adjusted in behavior and/or structure by adapting software and physics of the plant to avoid degeneration. Unfortunately, in industrial practice, changes, especially smaller ones, are often performed ad-hoc without appropriate adaptation of formal models or documentation. As a consequence, knowledge about the process is only implicitly available and an evaluation of performed changes is often omitted, resulting in sub-optimal production performance. Present research approaches to overcome these deficiencies usually concentrate on (a) manual modelling with manual or automatic analysis on a high level of abstraction; or (b) on automatic model generation from observations without lifting gathered knowledge to easy interpretable indicators. The approach presented in this paper combines both methods (a) and (b) by learning models from observation of input / output signals of the production plant’s control system. Semantics are added by using a priori information modelling which is less tedious compared to modelling the process itself. The learned models are used to automatically detect changes by continuously comparing their behavior with real plant behavior during operation as well as to evaluate performed changes. An analysis of the models results in high-level property values such as key performance indicators or flexibility measures of the production system.","2016-06-01","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:39","163-178","","2","2","","Intell Ind Syst","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\NN86N9M7\Ladiges et al. - 2016 - Automated Determining of Manufacturing Properties .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a method that works in three stages. First, the ExtraTrees classifier is used to select relevant features for each type of attack individually for each (ELM). Then, an ensemble of ELMs is used to detect each type of attack separately. Finally, the results of all ELMs are combined using a softmax layer to refine the results and increase the accuracy further. The intuition behind our system is that multi-class classification is quite difficult compared to binary classification. So, we divide the multi-class problem into multiple binary classifications. We test our method on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets. The results clearly show that our proposed method is able to outperform all the other methods, with a high margin. Our system is able to achieve 98.24% and 99.76% accuracy for multi-class classification on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets, respectively. Additionally, we use the weighted extreme learning machine to alleviate the problem of imbalance in classification of attacks, which further boosts performance. Lastly, we implement the ensemble of ELMs in parallel using GPUs to perform intrusion detection in real time.","2019-10-22","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:40","2021-06-07 21:21:39","15","","1","2019","","EURASIP J. on Info.
