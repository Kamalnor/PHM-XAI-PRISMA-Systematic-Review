Characterisation and monitoring of spattering behaviours are highly valuable in understanding the manufacturing process and improving the manufacturing quality of SLM. This paper introduces a method of automatic visual classification to distinguish spattering characteristics of SLM processes in different manufacturing conditions. A compact feature descriptor is proposed to represent spattering patterns and its effectiveness is evaluated using real images captured in different conditions. The feature descriptor of this work combines information of spatter trajectory morphology, spatial distributions, and temporal information. The classification is performed using support vector machine (SVM) and random forests for testing and shows highly promising classification accuracy of about 97%. The advantages of this work include compactness for representation and semantic interpretability with the feature description. In addition, the qualities of manufacturing parts are mapped with spattering characteristics under different laser energy densities. Such a map table can be then used to define the desired spatter features, providing a non-contact monitoring solution for online anomaly detection. This work will lead to a further integration of real-time vision monitoring system for an online closed-loop prognostic system for SLM systems, in order to improve the performance in terms of manufacturing quality, power consumption, and fault detection.","2020-10-01","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:46","2955-2976","","11","110","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\TJT94EH4\Ji and Han - 2020 - A novel image feature descriptor for SLM spatterin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the healthcare dataset. In the present work, a prognostic model using random forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19, and it is applied on an open healthcare dataset containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the healthcare dataset include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, and marital status along with medical data like coma score, pulmonary score, blood glucose level, HDL cholesterol, etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical and categorical values (non-numerical) and missing data in the healthcare dataset. The correlation between the variables in the healthcare data is analyzed using the correlation coefficient, and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-scores, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to support vector regression for the given healthcare dataset. Android-based mobile application software platform is developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.","2020-11-12","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:47","","","","","","Res.

More recently, however, India, and the distressing privacy annulling actions on the sub-continent have become the chief discussion point among those in the world who are alarmed over the ways in which personal privacy is being encroached upon by moneyed interests of all variety, and by those governments who are willing to collude with them, under false pretenses. In a nation with nearly 1.4 billion people, one readily identified as the world’s largest democracy, forces are now at work, arbitrarily, autocratically, undemocratically, and unconstitutionally deploying, what has come to be known as the world’s largest biometric national ID program (scans and captures iris, fingerprints and facial inputs into a government database), called The Aadhaar. The Aadhaar, initially sold to the tax-payer as a program only to exist per volunteer citizen participation, has speedily, and in the span of less than 2 years, gone from being that volunteer participation program, to a “you must enroll” program, intent on siphoning a citizen’s most personal information into government custody. More importantly, the government, against initial Supreme Court ruling, is now actively pushing for the widespread adoption of the Aadhaar into every segment of the Indian Society, without any constitutional reading, deliberation or ruling. As a member of the national parliament, and as the only opposing voice to the implementation of the Aadhaar, in a chamber of 545 members, the author aims to candidly introduce the reader to the leading issues that are enabling the Central government and moneyed interests to collude, and to suppress democratic processes to ramrod the Aadhaar legislation through the parliament as a ‘money bill,’ and what this Indian program and experience could herald.","2017-12-01","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:47","469-487","","4","7","","Health Technol.","The Aadhaar","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\G3PG4IST\Satpathy - 2017 - The Aadhaar “Evil” Embodied as Law.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.","2020-02-17","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-08 04:43:30","2021-06-07 21:05:47","1017-1037","","3","28","","Arch Computat Methods Eng","Multiscale Modeling Meets Machine Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\BK5GYA2X\Peng et al. - 2021 - Multiscale Modeling Meets Machine Learning What C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine abnormalities, unusual responses to controls or false alarms, are still common; therefore, a better understanding of how humans learn and respond to abnormal machine behaviour is essential. Human cognition has been researched in many domains. Numerous theories such as utility theory, three-level situation awareness and theory of dual cognition suggest how human cognition behaves. These theories present the varieties of human cognition including deliberate and naturalistic thinking. However, studies have not taken into consideration varieties of human cognition employed when responding to abnormal machine behaviour. This study reviews theories of cognition, along with empirical work on the significance of human cognition, including several case studies. The different propositions of human cognition concerning abnormal machine behaviour are compared to dual cognition theories. Our results show that situation awareness is a suitable framework to model human cognition of abnormal machine behaviour. We also propose a continuum which represents varieties of cognition, lying between explicit and implicit cognition. Finally, we suggest a theoretical approach to learn how the human cognition functions when responding to abnormal machine behaviour during a specific event. In conclusion, we posit that the model has implications for emerging waves of human-intelligent system collaboration.","2019-03-01","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:48","2021-06-07 21:05:48","3-26","","1","1","","Hum.-Intell.
