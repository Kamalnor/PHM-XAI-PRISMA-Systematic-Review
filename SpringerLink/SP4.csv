There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.","2020-02-17","2021-06-07 21:27:37","2021-06-08 18:50:40","2021-06-07 21:27:37","1017-1037","","3","28","","Arch Computat Methods Eng","Multiscale Modeling Meets Machine Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\XMCI28KH\Peng et al. - 2021 - Multiscale Modeling Meets Machine Learning What C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we compare different feature importance measures using both linear (logistic regression with L1 penalization) and non-linear (random forest) methods and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations on top of them. These methods are applied to two datasets from the medical domain, the openly available breast cancer data from the UCI Archive and a recently collected running injury data.

We propose a method that works in three stages. First, the ExtraTrees classifier is used to select relevant features for each type of attack individually for each (ELM). Then, an ensemble of ELMs is used to detect each type of attack separately. Finally, the results of all ELMs are combined using a softmax layer to refine the results and increase the accuracy further. The intuition behind our system is that multi-class classification is quite difficult compared to binary classification. So, we divide the multi-class problem into multiple binary classifications. We test our method on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets. The results clearly show that our proposed method is able to outperform all the other methods, with a high margin. Our system is able to achieve 98.24% and 99.76% accuracy for multi-class classification on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets, respectively. Additionally, we use the weighted extreme learning machine to alleviate the problem of imbalance in classification of attacks, which further boosts performance.

Characterisation and monitoring of spattering behaviours are highly valuable in understanding the manufacturing process and improving the manufacturing quality of SLM. This paper introduces a method of automatic visual classification to distinguish spattering characteristics of SLM processes in different manufacturing conditions. A compact feature descriptor is proposed to represent spattering patterns and its effectiveness is evaluated using real images captured in different conditions. The feature descriptor of this work combines information of spatter trajectory morphology, spatial distributions, and temporal information. The classification is performed using support vector machine (SVM) and random forests for testing and shows highly promising classification accuracy of about 97%. The advantages of this work include compactness for representation and semantic interpretability with the feature description. In addition, the qualities of manufacturing parts are mapped with spattering characteristics under different laser energy densities. Such a map table can be then used to define the desired spatter features, providing a non-contact monitoring solution for online anomaly detection. This work will lead to a further integration of real-time vision monitoring system for an online closed-loop prognostic system for SLM systems, in order to improve the performance in terms of manufacturing quality, power consumption, and fault detection.","2020-10-01","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:56","2955-2976","","11","110","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\EZHM5CY9\Ji and Han - 2020 - A novel image feature descriptor for SLM spatterin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the healthcare dataset. In the present work, a prognostic model using random forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19, and it is applied on an open healthcare dataset containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the healthcare dataset include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, and marital status along with medical data like coma score, pulmonary score, blood glucose level, HDL cholesterol, etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical and categorical values (non-numerical) and missing data in the healthcare dataset. The correlation between the variables in the healthcare data is analyzed using the correlation coefficient, and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-scores, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to support vector regression for the given healthcare dataset. Android-based mobile application software platform is developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.","2020-11-12","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:56","","","","","","Res.

BGA package types are of interest because defects are difficult to identify and costly to rework. While much of the existing research is dedicated to techniques to identify and diagnose BGA defects, this research attempts to preempt them by using parametric data measured by solder paste inspection (SPI) machines as input data to applied machine learning models. Two modeling approaches are explored: one approach to analyze individual solder paste deposits and the other approach to holistically analyze all solder paste deposits on a single PCB location. The latter approach employs feature generation to extract a broad set of features from the arrays of SPI data and feature selection techniques for dimensionality reduction. Models trained on the reduced feature sets provide encouraging initial results, with precision, recall, and f1 score metrics exceeding 0.82, 0.50, and 0.62 respectively for each of two datasets analyzed.","2020-01-06","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:57","2021-06-07 21:27:57","156","","2","2","","SN Appl.

During this long operational phase operation requirements and other production conditions change frequently. Accordingly, the plants have to be adjusted in behavior and/or structure by adapting software and physics of the plant to avoid degeneration. Unfortunately, in industrial practice, changes, especially smaller ones, are often performed ad-hoc without appropriate adaptation of formal models or documentation. As a consequence, knowledge about the process is only implicitly available and an evaluation of performed changes is often omitted, resulting in sub-optimal production performance. Present research approaches to overcome these deficiencies usually concentrate on (a) manual modelling with manual or automatic analysis on a high level of abstraction; or (b) on automatic model generation from observations without lifting gathered knowledge to easy interpretable indicators. The approach presented in this paper combines both methods (a) and (b) by learning models from observation of input / output signals of the production plant’s control system. Semantics are added by using a priori information modelling which is less tedious compared to modelling the process itself. The learned models are used to automatically detect changes by continuously comparing their behavior with real plant behavior during operation as well as to evaluate performed changes. An analysis of the models results in high-level property values such as key performance indicators or flexibility measures of the production system.","2016-06-01","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:19","163-178","","2","2","","Intell Ind Syst","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\K67D9A93\Ladiges et al. - 2016 - Automated Determining of Manufacturing Properties .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collection of articulatory data on a large scale may not be feasible in many scenarios, thus restricting the scope and applicability of such methods. In this paper, a discriminative learning method for emotion recognition using both articulatory and acoustic information is proposed. A traditional ℓ1-regularized logistic regression cost function is extended to include additional constraints that enforce the model to reconstruct articulatory data. This leads to sparse and interpretable representations jointly optimized for both tasks simultaneously. Furthermore, the model only requires articulatory features during training; only speech features are required for inference on out-of-sample data. Experiments are conducted to evaluate emotion recognition performance over vowels /AA/, /AE/, /IY/, /UW/ and complete utterances. Incorporating articulatory information is shown to significantly improve the performance for valence-based classification. Results obtained for within-corpus and cross-corpus categorical emotion recognition indicate that the proposed method is more effective at distinguishing happiness from other emotions.","2019-08-20","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","14","","1","2019","","J AUDIO SPEECH MUSIC PROC.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\UXGZQ2ZH\Shah et al. - 2019 - Articulation constrained learning with application.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall quality scores, represented as Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) produced by subjective test methodologies such as ITU-T P.800 Absolute Category Rating (ACR), remains the most popular quality metric in the industry. While MOS is a great indicator to evaluate quality issues, it does not provide information on the cause of issues. To address this gap, work items are currently active within ITU-T to provide the industry with means to understand the cause of lower scores by perceptual or technical degradation decompositions. The goal is to produce objective models that enable automated degradation decomposition. The first step in such a development is the construction of databases for model training and validation. For this, in sum four experiments using a potential diagnostic test method discussed within ITU-T are conducted. In addition, two optional improvements for the test method are presented and discussed. The results of the experiments show that for standardization the analyzed test method still leaves room for validation and further improvements.","2017-03-30","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","4","","1","2","","Qual User Exp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\TP8EUYUY\Köster et al. - 2017 - Towards degradation decomposition for voice commun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term was initially discussed in the context of emerging markets, giving non-affluent customers opportunities to consume affordable products and services suited to their needs. However, the meaning of frugal innovation is fuzzy. Further, the increasing appearance of frugal innovation in developed markets challenges earlier definitions that often characterised frugal innovation particularly in the context of emerging markets. So far, it has not been clear what differentiates frugal innovation from other innovation types. Thus, we need criteria that make it possible to determine what frugal innovation is and what is not. In order to determine a clear definition, we choose a multimethod approach, conduct a literature review, and interview 45 managers from companies and researchers from different research institutes. On the basis of the results, we define three criteria for frugal innovation: substantial cost reduction, concentration on core functionalities, and optimised performance level. We contribute to the literature by refining the meaning of frugal innovation. We also enable organisations to better deal with the challenge of developing frugal innovation in both emerging and developed markets.","2016-12-27","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","1","","1","2","","J Frugal Innov","What is frugal innovation?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\JPXIXST9\Weyrauch and Herstatt - 2016 - What is frugal innovation Three defining criteria.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinically interpretable parameters are estimated from quantitative measures (i.e. ground reaction forces, skin marker trajectories, etc.) through biomechanical modelling. In particular, the estimation of joint moments during motion is grounded on several modelling assumptions: (1) body segmental and joint kinematics is derived from the trajectories of markers and by modelling the human body as a kinematic chain; (2) joint resultant (net) loads are, usually, derived from force plate measurements through a model of segmental dynamics. Therefore, both measurement errors and modelling assumptions can affect the results, to an extent that also depends on the characteristics of the motor task analysed (i.e. gait speed). Errors affecting the trajectories of joint centres, the orientation of joint functional axes, the joint angular velocities, the accuracy of inertial parameters and force measurements (concurring to the definition of the dynamic model), can weigh differently in the estimation of clinically interpretable joint moments. Numerous studies addressed all these methodological aspects separately, but a critical analysis of how these aspects may affect the clinical interpretation of joint dynamics is still missing. This article aims at filling this gap through a systematic review of the literature, conducted on Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The final objective is hence to provide clear take-home messages to guide laboratories in the estimation of joint moments for the clinical practice.","2017-08-18","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","106","","1","16","","BioMed Eng OnLine","Methodological factors affecting joint moments estimation in clinical gait analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\3HW9KRH8\Camomilla et al. - 2017 - Methodological factors affecting joint moments est.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine abnormalities, unusual responses to controls or false alarms, are still common; therefore, a better understanding of how humans learn and respond to abnormal machine behaviour is essential. Human cognition has been researched in many domains. Numerous theories such as utility theory, three-level situation awareness and theory of dual cognition suggest how human cognition behaves. These theories present the varieties of human cognition including deliberate and naturalistic thinking. However, studies have not taken into consideration varieties of human cognition employed when responding to abnormal machine behaviour. This study reviews theories of cognition, along with empirical work on the significance of human cognition, including several case studies. The different propositions of human cognition concerning abnormal machine behaviour are compared to dual cognition theories. Our results show that situation awareness is a suitable framework to model human cognition of abnormal machine behaviour. We also propose a continuum which represents varieties of cognition, lying between explicit and implicit cognition. Finally, we suggest a theoretical approach to learn how the human cognition functions when responding to abnormal machine behaviour during a specific event. In conclusion, we posit that the model has implications for emerging waves of human-intelligent system collaboration.","2019-03-01","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","3-26","","1","1","","Hum.-Intell.

The accurate determination of the harmonics have been challenging as the small peaks of the harmonics in FFT are frequently hidden by varied deterministic vibrations and noise. In this paper, advanced singular value decomposition method is employed to enhance the accuracy of the detection of the multi-harmonics. The track matrix of attractor of TFC slider vibration time series in light contact with disk is reconstructed in phase space. By using singular value decomposition theory, the singular spectrum from reconstructed attractor track matrix is estimated in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the LDV response signal, which is further used for the accurate detection of uncertain, abrupt information and for early slider-disk light contact detection. This approach enables signal noise attenuation, which is critical to the accurate detection of weak harmonics, and enables the accurate extraction of light contact information, particularly for the transient abrupt cases, as well as improves the accuracy of harmonics-based system identification.","2015-12-01","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","2761-2769","","12","21","","Microsyst Technol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\B2FEMM8S\He et al. - 2015 - Accurate detection of light contact of thermal fly.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Angiography is one of the benchmarked diagnoses for detection of CAD; however, it is costly, invasive, and requires a high level of technical expertise. This paper discusses a data mining technique that uses noninvasive clinical data to identify CAD cases. The clinical data of 335 subjects were collected at the cardiology department, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, India, over the period of 2012–2013. Only 48.9% subjects showed coronary stenosis in coronary angiography and were confirmed cases of CAD. A large number of cases (171 out of 335) were found normal after invasive diagnosis. Hence, a requirement of noninvasive technique was felt that could identify CAD cases without going for invasive diagnosis. We applied data mining classification techniques on noninvasive clinical data. The data set is analyzed using a hybrid and novel k-means cluster centroid-based method for missing value imputation and C4.5, NB Tree and multilayer perceptron for modeling to predict CAD patients. The proposed hybrid method increases the accuracy achieved by the basic techniques of classification. This framework is a promising tool for screening CAD and its severity with high probability and low cost.","2018-03-01","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:21","2021-06-07 21:28:20","11-18","","1","4","","Complex Intell.

The results are materialized by a new design and manufacturing strategy of customized orthopedic endoprostheses. The strategy is presented in a case study. The design methodology consists in processing, editing, analyzing, and performing measurements with the Materialise’s Interactive Medical Image Control System (MIMICS) software in order to extract and develop the 3-D model from specific computed tomography (CT) files. The finite element analysis (FEA) was used in order to verify the distribution of the cortical bone tissue of a femur and to evaluate the prosthesis by simulating normal and atypical daily activities. The contact surfaces and the elements of the endoprosthesis were established taking into account the distribution of the von Mises equivalent stress in the section carrying the highest loads. It was elaborated a strategy that allows reproducing anatomic bone shapes by using Bézier curves and obtaining parameterized 3-D models. After determining the ideal shape, the prosthesis to be fabricated by SLM was designed and analyzed. An original item of the research is the design of a multistructural endoprosthesis consisting in three elements with different structural proprieties. The proposed prosthesis model is a perfectible solution, the research being focused exclusively on the considered case. By studying the distribution of bone structures, their shapes, and dimensions, new prostheses can be obtained following the steps of the strategy elaborated in this study.","2015-07-01","2021-06-07 21:28:48","2021-06-07 21:28:48","2021-06-07 21:28:47","905-920","","5","79","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GN7A64LF\Leordean et al. - 2015 - Studies on design of customized orthopedic endopro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no work available that investigates the performance of ML-based methods against the text expression-based method, especially for incident and medical case categorization. Meanwhile, these two domains are becoming ever more popular, due to a growing interest of automation in security intelligence and health services. This paper presents a text expression-based method called Evolving Fuzzy Grammar (EFG) and evaluates its performance against the conventional ML methods of Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, $$k$$-nearest neighbor, adaptive booting, and decision tree. The incident dataset used is a real dataset that was taken from the World Incidents Tracking System, while ImageCLEF 2009 was used as the source for radiology case reports. The results suggested variations of strength and weakness of each method in both categorization tasks, where a standard evaluation technique (i.e., recall, precision, and $$F$$-measure) was used. In both domains, the SMO and IBk methods were the best, while AdaBoost was the worst. It was also observed that the medical dataset was easier to categorize than the incident. Although EFG was ranked second lowest, it obtained the highest precision score in the bombing categorization, the highest score in armed attack recall, and was averagely ranked in the top three for the medical case categorization. It was also noted that the text expression-based method used in EFG was the most verbose and expressive, when compared to the ML methods. This indicates that EFG is a viable method in text categorization and may serve as an alternative approach to such a task.","2015-06-01","2021-06-07 21:28:48","2021-06-07 21:28:48","2021-06-07 21:28:48","1701-1714","","6","19","","Soft Comput","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\ZW8JE23L\Sharef et al. - 2015 - A comparative study of evolving fuzzy grammar and .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
