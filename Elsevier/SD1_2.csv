Early diagnosis can improve treatment for patients and is performed through dopaminergic imaging techniques like the SPECT DaTSCAN. In this study, we propose a machine learning model that accurately classifies any given DaTSCAN as having Parkinson's disease or not, in addition to providing a plausible reason for the prediction. This kind of reasoning is done through the use of visual indicators generated using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explainer (LIME) methods. DaTSCANs were drawn from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database and trained on a CNN (VGG16) using transfer learning, yielding an accuracy of 95.2%, a sensitivity of 97.5%, and a specificity of 90.9%. Keeping model interpretability of paramount importance, especially in the healthcare field, this study utilises LIME explanations to distinguish PD from non-PD, using visual superpixels on the DaTSCANs. It could be concluded that the proposed system, in union with its measured interpretability and accuracy may effectively aid medical workers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.","2020-11-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","104041","","","126","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\L6CMVYCM\S0010482520303723.html","","","Convolutional neural network; Computer-aided diagnosis; Interpretability; Explainable AI; Parkinson's disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the commonly-used imaging modalities that can be used to understand human brain mechanisms as well as the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. The advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of deep learning techniques have shown promising results to better interpret fMRI data. Deep learning techniques have rapidly become the state of the art for analyzing fMRI data sets and resulted in performance improvements in diverse fMRI applications. Deep learning is normally presented as an end-to-end learning process and can alleviate feature engineering requirements and hence reduce domain knowledge requirements to some extent. Under the framework of deep learning, fMRI data can be considered as images, time series or images series. Hence, different deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural network, or a combination of both, can be developed to process fMRI data for different tasks. In this review, we discussed the basics of deep learning methods and focused on its successful implementations for brain disorder diagnosis based on fMRI images. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of brain disorder diagnosis with fMRI images from the perspective of deep learning applications.","2020-10-28","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","","","","","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\CQA2YP7D\S0925231220316210.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Diagnosis; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Brain disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interpreting chest X-ray (CXR) images is challenging since the 2D CXR images show the superimposition on internal organs/tissues with low resolution and poor boundaries. Unlike previous CXR computer-aided diagnosis works that focused on disease diagnosis/classification, we firstly propose a deep disentangled generative model (DGM) simultaneously generating abnormal disease residue maps and “radiorealistic” normal CXR images from an input abnormal CXR image. The intuition of our method is based on the assumption that disease regions usually superimpose upon or replace the pixels of normal tissues in an abnormal CXR. Thus, disease regions can be disentangled or decomposed from the abnormal CXR by comparing it with a generated patient-specific normal CXR. DGM consists of three encoder-decoder architecture branches: one for radiorealistic normal CXR image synthesis using adversarial learning, one for disease separation by generating a residue map to delineate the underlying abnormal region, and the other one for facilitating the training process and enhancing the model’s robustness on noisy data. A self-reconstruction loss is adopted in the first two branches to enforce the generated normal CXR image to preserve similar visual structures as the original CXR. We evaluated our model on a large-scale chest X-ray dataset. The results show that our model can generate disease residue/saliency maps (coherent with radiologist annotations) along with radiorealistic and patient specific normal CXR images. The disease residue/saliency map can be used by radiologists to improve the CXR reading efficiency in clinical practice. The synthesized normal CXR can be used for data augmentation and normal control of personalized longitudinal disease study. Furthermore, DGM quantitatively boosts the diagnosis performance on several important clinical applications, including normal/abnormal CXR classification, and lung opacity classification/detection.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","101839","","","67","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Chest radiography (X-ray); Disease decomposition; Disentangled representation learning; Medical image synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasma-assisted fuel reforming kinetic mechanisms have predominantly been evaluated on the basis of matching reactant conversion and syngas production to steady-state measurements, which cannot describe the full range of chemistry and physics necessary to validate the model. It was found that adding 1% CH4 to a pure He ns-DBD led to a faster breakdown along the rising edge of the applied voltage pulse, thereby lowering the reduced electric field (E/N), electron number density, and electron temperature. Further addition of CH4 did not continue to alter the E/N in the model. Laser absorption spectroscopy was used to measure gas temperature, C2H2, H2O, and CH2O in a CH4/CO2/He discharge to serve as validation targets for the predicted reaction pathways. CH2O was predicted within 25% of the measured value, while H2O and C2H2 were under-predicted by a factor of two and three, respectively. From path flux analysis, the major pathway for CH2O formation was through the reaction between CH3 and O, while C2H2 formation had multi-step pathways that relied on ions like CH3+ and C2H5+. The path flux analysis also shows that CH2 is a significant intermediate for production of both CH2O and C2H2, and increased CH2 concentration could improve model predictions. The results show that the use of reaction rate constants with lower uncertainties and inclusion of He2+ are needed to improve the predictions. Finally, varying the ”equivalence ratio”, defined by the CH4 dry reforming reaction to H2 and CO, from 0.5 to 2 was shown to have a weak effect on measured product species and experimental trends were explained based on pathways extracted from the model.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","6533-6540","","4","38","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Chemical kinetics; Methane dry reforming; Non-equilibrium plasma; Plasma assisted fuel reforming; Pyrolysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concentration evolutions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) intermediates were measured in a temperature range of 1100–1800 K by analyzing the post-shock gas mixtures. Different PAH speciation behaviors, regarding types, concentrations and formation temperature windows, were observed in the two reaction systems. A kinetic model was proposed to predict and interpret the measurements. Through a combination of experimental and modeling efforts, PAH formation patterns from species pools of benzene and toluene pyrolysis were illustrated. In both cases, channels leading to PAHs basically originate from the respective fuel radicals, phenyl and benzyl. Due to the higher thermal stability of benzene, the production of phenyl, and thus most PAH species, occur in higher temperature windows, in comparison to the case of toluene. In benzene pyrolysis, benzyne participates in the formation of crucial PAH species such as naphthalene and acenaphthylene. Phenyl self-recombination takes considerable carbon flux into biphenyl, which serves as an important intermediate leading to acenaphthylene through hydrogen loss and ring closure. The resonantly-stabilized benzyl is abundant in toluene pyrolysis, and its decomposition further produces other resonantly-stabilized radicals such as fulvenallenyl and propargyl. Barrierless addition reactions among these radicals are found to be important sources of PAHs. Fuel-specific pathways have pronounced effects on PAH speciation behaviors, particularly at lower temperatures where fuel depletion is not completed within the reaction time of 4.0 ms. Contributions from the commonly existing Hydrogen-Abstraction-Carbon-Addition (HACA) routes increase with the temperature in both cases.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","891-900","","1","38","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Pyrolysis; Benzene; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Single-pulse shock tube; Toluene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the chemical evolution of various functional groups, including aromatic CH, aliphatic CH, C=O, COH and COC bonds, was experimentally investigated online, rather than with offline diagnostics. Oxidation was performed in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR), fueled with benzene/C2H2/air/N2 and benzene/phenol/C2H2/N2 for a temperature range of 600-1400 K. Kinetic modelling, including ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, reaction rate coefficient calculations and JSR simulations, were conducted to interpret the experimental data and the evolutionary chemistry of the various functional groups. Results show that the formation of functional groups on PAH and oxygenated PAH (OPAH) are highly sensitive to temperature. Aliphatic CH bonds survive mainly in the form of CCH2C, CCH2CH2C or CCH functional groups above 1200 K, and exist in the CHCH2 functional group below 1000 K. For the OPAH, the COC functional group presents stronger thermal stability than COH and C=O functional groups. Simulation results indicate that HACA-like pathway (hydrogen abstraction carbon addition), in which C2H2 attacks the O atom, followed by cyclization and H-atom elimination reactions, qualitatively describe the formation of OPAH with the CO-C functional group at different temperatures. The addition reaction involving PAH radical and C2H4 / C2H3 captures the evolution of PAH with the CHCH2 functional group, but fails to explain the formation of CCH2C and CCH2CH2C functional groups.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","1467-1475","","1","38","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Functional groups; OPAH; PAH; Soot; Temperature dependence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among patients with cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction (MI) is the main reason. Precise and timely identification of MI is significant for early treatment. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is widely used for the detection of MI in clinic practice. However, existing clinical exam using MCE is subjective and highly operator dependent and time-consuming. Hence an automatic computer-aided MI detection in MCE is necessary to improve the diagnosis performance and decrease the workload of clinicians. Methods In this study, a novel deep learning model, polar residual network (PResNet) is proposed to identify MI regions in MCE images which design a polar layer considering the ring shape of the myocardium. MCE images are fed into the PResNet and a newly defined polar layer is used to describe the myocardium with a ring shape. The whole polar images are evenly divided into several subsections and a residual network is improved to classify the subsection into normal and abnormal categories. Finally, the detection results are mapped back to the original image to illustrate the infarction regions’ locations for the further process. Results To evaluate the proposed PResNet, a dataset is constructed via performing MCE on five mice, which underwent the left anterior descending artery ligation and receive erythropoietin or saline injection, and the area variation fraction is manually annotated by an experienced expert as golden standards. The results demonstrate that the proposed PResNet model accomplishes high classification precisions with 99.6% and 98.7%, and 0.999 and 0.996 of AUC (area under the receiver operator curve) values on two different testing sets, respectively. Results suggest that the proposed model could enable accurate infarct detection and diagnosis of the MCE images. Conclusion Those efficiency gains highlight the powerful ability to describe and interpret the MCE images using the polar layer and residual network. The proposed PResNet might aid the clinicians in fast and accurate assessing the infarcted myocardium on MCE.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","105791","","","198","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Infarct detection; Myocardial contrast echocardiography; Polar system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All the NO time-histories measured over the entire temperature range 1013 K–1418 K were well-predicted by this model in terms of the initial NO formation rate and the final plateau level. The rate-of-production, sensitivity, and reaction flux analyses were performed to identify four important reactions (CH3NO2 = CH3 + NO2, CH3NO2 ↔ CH3ONO = CH3O + NO, CH3 + NO2 = CH3O + NO, and NO2 + H = NO + OH) that determine the NO formation during CH3NO2 pyrolysis. The satisfactory agreement between the simulation and shock tube/laser absorption measurement further validated the kinetic mechanism of nitromethane decomposition. The developed mid-infrared NO absorption sensor provides a promising diagnostic tool for studying fuel-nitrogen chemical kinetics in the shock tube experiments.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","1745-1752","","1","38","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Absorption spectroscopy; Nitromethane pyrolysis; NO diagnostic; Shock tube","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data characteristics that lack of labels, very long sequences and irregularly variable lengths make generating proper representations for the sequences for anomaly detection quite challenging. Traditional methods combining shallow models with feature engineering require lots of time and effort from researchers. And they only catch short patterns for the sequences. Recently deep learning is paid more and more attention due to its excellent performance on data representation. Current works simply adopt recurrent neural network based models to this task. They learn the local patterns of the sequences but can not view the sequences globally. Besides, the variable length makes the deep models that accept fixed-size inputs unavailable. Moreover, the deep models usually lack interpretability. Here an unsupervised deep learning framework utilizing attention mechanism called ADSAD is proposed to address these issues. ADSAD takes both the data characteristics and the limitation of the deep models into consideration and generate the global representations for the sequences by two steps, in which the attention mechanism is applied to improve the interpretability. The empirical results showed that the ADSAD instances significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art deep models, with the relative AUC improvement of up to 7%. The attention mechanism not only enhanced the detection performance by up to 73% in terms of AUC but was also able to assist experts for anomaly analysis by visualization.","2020-12-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:41","102070","","","99","","Computers & Security","ADSAD","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Attention mechanism; Anomaly detection; Payloads; Sequence representation; Syscalls","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, alkali chlorides are the main reasons that explain why steam parameters are less advanced and efficient in biomass and waste-based power generation when compared to coal. These problems can be mitigated by introducing sulphur into the system to form alkali sulphates that are not as problematic on steel surfaces as alkali chlorides. However, the alkali sulphation process in realistic combustion environments needs further exploration. Thus, new diagnostic methods for in-situ monitoring of alkali sulphation kinetics in combustion systems are required. In this work, the simultaneous monitoring of KCl and KOH concentrations in a pilot-scale combustor using Collinear Photofragmentation and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CPFAAS) during stationary and transient operation of the combustor, is introduced. The CPFAAS information is complemented by monitoring SO2 and HCl concentrations using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The temporal performance of the system is demonstrated by measuring the temporal combustor response curves for KCl sulphation for different Cl/K ratios during rapid changes in gaseous SO2 concentrations. The temporal concentration curves obtained imply that the Cl/K ratio has a significant impact on the temporal alkali sulphation behaviour.

With harsh operating conditions and increasing complicated system, this industry urgently needs research on more efficient fault isolation and cause diagnosis methods.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information.

As a matter of fact, forecast of forthcoming faults is crucial to implement predictive maintenance, i.e. maintenance decision making based on real time information from components and systems, which allows, among other benefits, to reduce maintenance cost, minimize downtime, increase safety, enhance product quality and productivity. However, building a model able to predict the future occurrence of a failure is challenging for various reasons. First, data are usually highly imbalanced, meaning that patterns describing a faulty regime are much less numerous than normal behavior instances, which makes model design difficult. Second, model predictions should be not only accurate (to avoid false alarms and missed detections) but also explainable to operators responsible for scheduling maintenance or control actions. In this paper we introduce a method called Interpretable Anomaly Prediction (IAP) allowing to handle these issues by using regularized logistic regression as core prediction model. In particular, in contrast to anomaly detection algorithms which permit to identify if the current data are anomalous or not, the proposed technique is able to predict the probability that future data will be abnormal. Furthermore, feature extraction and selection mechanisms give insights on the possible root causes leading to failures. The proposed strategy is validated with a large imbalanced multivariate time-series dataset consisting of measurements of several process variables surrounding an high pressure plunger pump situated in a complex chemical plant.","2020-11-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-15 08:14:11","2021-06-05 17:24:41","101850","","","130","","Data & Knowledge Engineering","Interpretable Anomaly Prediction","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework incorporates the Dirichlet process, which is an unsupervised clustering method, and kernel principal component analysis with a new kernel specialized for multimode data. A monitoring model is trained using the data obtained from several healthy operating modes. When on-line, if a new healthy operating mode is confirmed by an operator, the monitoring model is updated using data collected in the new mode. Implementation issues of this framework, including the parameter tuning for the kernel and the selection of anomaly indicators, are also discussed. A bivariate numerical simulation is used to demonstrate the performance of anomaly detection of the monitoring model. The ability of this framework in model updating and anomaly detection in new operating modes is shown on data from an industrial-scale process using the PRONTO benchmark dataset.

Several research efforts are being made to exploit sensorized smart-homes and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to detect a decline of the cognitive functions of the elderly in order to promptly alert practitioners. Even though those tools may provide accurate predictions, they currently provide limited support to clinicians in making a diagnosis. Indeed, most AI systems do not provide any explanation of the reason why a given prediction was computed. Other systems are based on a set of rules that are easy to interpret by a human. However, those rule-based systems can cope with a limited number of abnormal situations, and are not flexible enough to adapt to different users and contextual situations. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing a flexible AI system to recognize early symptoms of cognitive decline in smart-homes, which is able to explain the reason of predictions at a fine-grained level. Our method relies on well known clinical indicators that consider subtle and overt behavioral anomalies, as well as spatial disorientation and wandering behaviors. In order to adapt to different individuals and situations, anomalies are recognized using a collaborative approach. We experimented our approach with a large set of real world subjects, including people with MCI and people with dementia. We also implemented a dashboard to allow clinicians to inspect anomalies together with the explanations of predictions. Results show that our system’s predictions are significantly correlated to the person’s actual diagnosis. Moreover, a preliminary user study with clinicians suggests that the explanation capabilities of our system are useful to improve the task performance and to increase trust.

For straight cables, the sectional rigidity is generally assumed to be a known quantity and the end conditions are presumptive. Nevertheless, given data of these parameters could be vague or unreliable. Methodologies which omit the requirement of a priori data are thus preferable in practice. This paper illustrates an effective methodology for the tension prediction of cables with presumptive end conditions by making use of multiple measured mode frequencies. Simple yet accurate formulas are obtained from the exact expressions based on the Bernoulli beam theory. Due to the fact that this approach does not require the knowledge of the flexural rigidity of the testing cable and it can be performed using only a single sensor, the method is suitable to be implemented in a quick diagnosis scheme.

Quantitative speciation profiles were probed from each reaction system over the temperature range of 1100–1700 K at a nominal pressure of 20 bar. A kinetic model was proposed to interpret how phenylacetylene is consumed under high-pressure pyrolytic conditions and how the resulting intermediates react to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and furthermore, how the extra acetylene or ethylene alter the reaction schemes. It was found that the bimolecular reaction between phenylacetylene and hydrogen atom leading to phenyl and acetylene dominates phenylacetylene decomposition throughout the temperature window. The addition/elimination reactions between phenylacetylene and phenyl not only produce hydrogen atoms to maintain the reactivity of the fuel decay, but also directly lead to the formation of several C14H10 PAH isomers including diphenylacetylene, 9-methylene-fluorene and phenanthrene. Intermediates pools, regarding both species categories and abundance, are changed by the two C2 fuels introduced into the reaction system. The added acetylene enables the Hydrogen-Abstraction-Acetylene-Addition (HACA) mechanism starting from the phenylacetylene radical to occur at relatively low temperatures. But the yielded naphthyl core does not stabilize in naphthalene due to the lack of hydrogen atoms in the reaction system, and instead, it carries on the HACA route by further combining with another acetylene molecule, ending up in acenaphthylene.

In this work, a supervised machine learning-based methodology is proposed, allowing the determination of subsets of relevant splicing components that best discriminate samples. The methodology comprises three main phases: first, a ranking of features is determined by means of applying feature weighting algorithms that compute the importance of each splicing component; second, the best subset of features that allows the induction of an accurate classifier is determined by means of conducting an effective heuristic search; then the confidence over the induced classifier is assessed by means of explaining the individual predictions and its global behavior.

In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system’s use of data, 2) the system’s potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance.

However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation and show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:44","101872","","","67","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adversarial training; Graph neural network; Logical reasoning; Medical image analysis; Medical report generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OCC is thus opposed to traditional classification problems involving two or more classes, and addresses the issue of class unbalance.

But at the time of explainable artificial intelligence, there is an increasing need for interpretable models. The present work advocates a novel one-class model which tackles this challenge. Within a greedy and recursive approach, our proposal for an explainable One-Class decision Tree (OC-Tree) rests on kernel density estimation to split a data subset on the basis of one or several intervals of interest. Thus, the OC-Tree encloses data within hyper-rectangles of interest which can be described by a set of rules. Against state-of-the-art methods such as Cluster Support Vector Data Description (ClusterSVDD), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and isolation Forest (iForest), the OC-Tree performs favorably on a range of benchmark datasets.

Due to the “black box” problem in DNNs, there are still many obstacles to the application of DNNs in fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a new DNN model, knowledge-based deep belief network (KBDBN), which inserts confidence and classification rules into the deep network structure. This not only enables the model to have good pattern recognition performance but also to adaptively determine the network structure and obtain a good understanding of the features learned by the deep network. The knowledge extraction algorithm is proposed to offer a good representation of layerwise networks (i.e., restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)). The layerwise extraction can produce an improvement in feature learning of RBMs. Moreover, the extracted confidence rules that characterize the deep network offers a novel method for insertion of prior knowledge in the deep RBM. The classification knowledge extracted from the data is further inserted into the classification layer of DBN. KBDBN is used to generate the discriminant features from the data and then construct a complex mapping between vibration signals and gearbox defects. The testing results of KBDBN on a gearbox test rig not only effectively extracts knowledge from the deep network, but also shows better classification performance than the typical classifiers and DBNs. Moreover, the interpretable network model helps us understand what DBN has learned from vibration signals and then makes it be applied easily in real-world cases.","2020-06-07","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-15 07:39:51","2021-06-05 17:24:44","105883","","","197","","Knowledge-Based Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Deep belief network; Feature learning; Gearbox fault diagnosis; Knowledge discovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with this challenge, a hybrid prediction method is proposed based on long short-term memory networks and artificial neural networks. The second challenge is that data driven-based models are hard to explain by domain knowledge.

Methods Cases of 15 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed: their epidemiology, clinical history, laboratory tests, and multiple CT chest scans obtained during the disease period were studied. Results The CT scans of the 15 patients showed different results. Four patients had no abnormal findings in their chest CT scans. The first scan of 1 patient revealed right lower lobe inflammation, while the lesion had been completely absorbed in follow-up. Two patients showed bilateral pulmonary inflammation in the first scan which had been absorbed by follow-up but the last examination showed extensive fibrosis. Two patients had no abnormalities in their first CT scans, while pulmonary inflammation was found in the second scan and this had not been completely absorbed by the last follow-up. One patient had pulmonary interstitial lesions with no evidence of National Cochlear Implant Programme (NCIP) on the first and second CT scans. NCIP was found at the third scan, and pulmonary inflammation was not completely absorbed at the last follow-up. Three patients were in the early stage of inflammation at the first scan, and the lesions were absorbed and repaired at the last follow-up. However, the lesions were not completely absorbed. One patient was in the advanced stage at the first scan, and the last follow-up pulmonary lesions were not completely absorbed. The first CT scan of 1 patient revealed large ground-glass opacity in the lungs involving the inner and middle bands. After follow-up, the disease progressed, and this condition was consistent with severe manifestations. Conclusion The follow-up of chest CT can reflect the change process of NCIP and the treatment effect. The first CT scan of lung lesions has a certain predictive effect on the outcome and prognosis of patients.","2020-09-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:44","106-113","","3","7","","Radiology of Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","COVID-19; Chest CT scan follow-up; Clinical history; Epidemiology; Laboratory tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It enables us to foresee future conditions and avoid unexpected risks. Recently, considerable accomplishments in the field of rotating machinery PHM has achieved through regression analysis based data-driven prognostics, which assist in directly analyzing and exploring the relationships between degradation trend and characterization indicators. Internal static structures still widely exist in most of them, inevitably restricting the natural extrapolation or generalization to future moments. Thus, the autoregression theories with complete mathematical foundations are first introduced and extended the methodologies for rotating machinery DTE. Meanwhile, the characterization ability of degradation or damage information from a single indicator rather than multi-endogenous indicators considering their causality and interactions may significantly reduce in the existing regression analysis based prognostics, and it further influences the final prognostics. Therefore, the idea of exploring internal dynamic structural regression based prognostics containing establishing multi-endogenous degradation indicators with weak-stationary traits and an interpretable and lightweight vector autoregression based DTE modeling method is motivated. The above dilemmas are well addressed through the in-depth study of autoregression based prognostics, namely stationary subspaces-vector autoregressive with exogenous terms (SSVARX). To be specific, multi-channel vibration signals are first picked up, and non-stationary signals are converted into time and frequency domain based weak-stationary degradation indicators via double stationary subspace decomposition and differential operation. Then the above two domain endogenous variables are feed into our proposed DTE models after stationarity test, order determination, and impulse response analysis. Finally, promising results from two run-to-failed life tests of rolling and slewing bearings are obtained via our multi-endogenous variables based extrapolation model. Compared with existing prediction methodologies, SSVARX of this study achieves not only high-accurate prediction results but also fast-computing speed and reasonable mathematical supports.","2021-03-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-15 07:39:55","2021-06-05 17:24:44","107293","","","150","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Prognostics and health management; Rolling bearings; Degradation trend estimation; Multi-endogenous variables based extrapolation model; Slewing bearings; Weak-stationary degradation indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The damage severity and direction of the measure point can be precisely described with the VMTES damage assessment indicator, providing the reliable basis for the structural health monitoring and fault diagnosis of the mechanical system. By applying the result to the state recognition of a chaotic system and the structural health monitoring of a rotating machinery system, we can see from the experimental results that the VMTES can effectively detect the fault of gears and rolling bearings under several working conditions.

Imaging techniques such as MRI are used to detect anatomical (structural) pathological changes. However, these kinds of changes are usually seen only late in the development. The measurement of functional brain activity by means of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can provide useful information, but its interpretation is more difficult. The scaled sub-profile model principal component analysis (SSM/PCA) was shown to provide more useful information than other statistical techniques. Our objective is to improve the performance further by combining SSM/PCA and prototype-based generalized matrix learning vector quantization (GMLVQ). Methods: We apply a combination of SSM/PCA and GMLVQ as a classifier. In order to demonstrate the combination’s validity, we analyze FDG-PET data of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients collected at three different neuroimaging centers in Europe. We determine the diagnostic performance by performing a ten times repeated ten fold cross validation. Additionally, discriminant visualizations of the data are included. The prototypes and relevance of GMLVQ are transformed back to the original voxel space by exploiting the linearity of SSM/PCA. The resulting prototypes and relevance profiles have then been assessed by three neurologists. Results: One important finding is that discriminative visualization can help to identify disease-related properties as well as differences which are due to center-specific factors. Secondly, the neurologist assessed the interpretability of the method and confirmed that prototypes are similar to known activity profiles of PD patients. Conclusion: We have shown that the presented combination of SSM/PCA and GMLVQ can provide useful means to assess and better understand characteristic differences in FDG-PET data from PD patients and HCs. Based on the assessments by medical experts and the results of our computational analysis we conclude that the first steps towards a diagnostic support system have been taken successfully.","2020-12-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:44","105708","","","197","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","[F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); generalized matrix learning vector quantization (GMLVQ); Parkinson’s disease (PD); Scaled sub-profile scaling model principal component analysis (SSM/PCA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary challenge is that process disturbances propagate between different operating units because of the flow of material and information. Data-driven causality analysis techniques, such as Granger causality (GC) test, have been widely adopted to construct process causal maps for root cause diagnosis. However, the generated causal map is over-complicated and difficult to interpret because of the existence of process loops and the violation of statistical assumptions. In this work, a two-step procedure is proposed to solve this problem. First, a causal map is built by adopting the conditional GC analysis, which is viewed as a graph in the next step. In this graph, each vertex corresponds to a process variable under investigation, while the weight of the edge connecting two vertices is the F-value calculated by conditional GC. This graph is then simplified by computing its maximum spanning tree. Thus, the results of the causality analysis are transformed into a directed acyclic graph, which eliminates all loops, highlights the root cause variable, and facilitates the diagnosis. The feasibility of this method is illustrated with the application to the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process. In the investigated case studies, the proposed method outperforms the conditional GC test and provides an easy way to identify the root cause of process disturbances.","2020-11-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:44","45-54","","","95","","Journal of Process Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Process monitoring; Causality analysis; Granger causality; Maximum spanning tree; Root cause diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, excessive nodes will inevitably lead to structural redundancy, which hinders its application in systems with high real-time performance requirements but limited onboard storage and computing capacity. Considering the well interpretability of sparse learning, this study introduces the group sparse structure for KELM to resolve its limitation of structural redundancy. Specifically, the proposed novel method introduces a special norm to reformulate the dual optimization problem of KELM to realize group sparse structure in output weights. As a result, nodes with large weights can be selected as the significant nodes, while nodes with small weights will be regarded as the redundant nodes and neglected directly. In addition, we have also devised an alternating iterative optimization algorithm and deduced the complete proof of convergence to solve the non-smoothness optimization problem in proposed method. Then, the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are verified by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

Deep learning (DL) on the other hand possess of higher predictive power than many other models. How reliable the result is, how it is deduced, how interpretable the prediction by DL mean to users, remain obscure. DL functions like a black box. As a result, many medical practitioners are reductant to use deep learning as the only tool for critical machine learning application, such as aiding tool for cancer diagnosis. Methods In this paper, a framework of white learning is being proposed which takes advantages of both black box learning and white box learning. Usually, black box learning will give a high standard of accuracy and white box learning will provide an explainable direct acyclic graph. According to our design, there are 3 stages of White Learning, loosely coupled WL, semi coupled WL and tightly coupled WL based on degree of fusion of the white box learning and black box learning. In our design, a case of loosely coupled WL is tested on breast cancer dataset. This approach uses deep learning and an incremental version of Naïve Bayes network. White learning is largely defied as a systemic fusion of machine learning models which result in an explainable Bayes network which could find out the hidden relations between features and class and deep learning which would give a higher accuracy of prediction than other algorithms. We designed a series of experiments for this loosely coupled WL model. Results The simulation results show that using WL compared to standard black-box deep learning, the levels of accuracy and kappa statistics could be enhanced up to 50%. The performance of WL seems more stable too in extreme conditions such as noise and high dimensional data. The relations by Bayesian network of WL are more concise and stronger in affinity too.

Animation is a natural choice to display time-dependent medical image data or unsteady biomedical simulation data where the dynamic nature of the data is mapped to a kind of video. Animation, however, may also be employed for static data, e.g., to move a camera along a predefined path to convey complex anatomical structures or the spatial relations around a pathology. Clipping planes may be smoothly translated and object transparency adapted to control visibility and further support emphasis of spatial relations, e.g., around a tumor. Virtual endoscopy, where the virtual camera is moved inside an air-filled or fluid-filled structure, is a prominent example of animating static data.

However, it is one-sided to express and interpret gait data from a single point of view, which cannot reflect multi-dimensional characteristics of gait changes. Moreover, if the gait pattern observed from other views has pathological or abnormal behavior, or has micro movement, it is not easy to be detected and thus affects the recognition rate of gait. In addition, the multi-view fusion of gait knowledge can be challenging due to the close correlation between various visual angles. Owing to the above facts, we propose a spiderweb graph neural network (SpiderNet) to solve the multi-view gait recognition problem, which connects the gait data of single view with that of other views concurrently and constructs an active graph convolutional neural network. The gait trajectory of each view is analyzed by the combination of a memory module and a capsule module, which accomplishes the multi-view feature fusion, as well as the spatio-temporal feature extraction of single view.

Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources and design targeted policies for vulnerable subgroups have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today’s ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. Objective To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient’s basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital and hence serve citizens and policy makers to assess individual risk during a pandemic. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient’s features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). Materials and Methods National data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied and compared, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. Results Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 72 %, 79 %, 89 %, and 90 % for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization:age, pregnancy, diabetes, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, and immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, immunosuppression, chronic renal insufficiency, obesity and diabetes; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, obesity, and hypertension.","2020-10-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","104258","","","142","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","Personalized predictive models for symptomatic COVID-19 patients using basic preconditions","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","COVID-19; Predictive models; SARS-CoV-2; Mortality; Coronavirus; Electronic health records (EHRs); Hospitalization; ICU; Ventilator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonlinear output frequency response functions (NOFRFs) solve nonlinear problems in the frequency domain and explain these nonlinear phenomena. Based on NOFRFs, a method named weighted contribution rate of NOFRFs (WNOFRFs) is used to improve the weak high-order harmonic components proposed by the authors. In this paper, the multi-parameter optimized genetic algorithm is used to calculate the obstacle parameters of the stochastic resonance (SR) which is used to enhance weak signal components. In view of the fact that both WNOFRFs and SR can improve the weak signal components, a new method of weighted contribution rate of NOFRFs incorporating stochastic resonance (WNS) algorithm is proposed in this paper.

New methodological aspects of thermoeconomic applications are developed, such as a new method for setting the productive dynamic structure, in particular to define the commonly used three-way valves and the inertial components. Besides, a novel easy-to-use methodology is explained to filter the induced effects; and, consequently, a new way to solve the direct problem of the diagnosis is obtained. Some crucial aspects of Second Law applications are discussed and all of this is applied to a real HVAC&R system using data from an experimental test in which a two-fault operation condition was deliberately assigned. The results demonstrate that this new thermoeconomic methodology can be applied to systems that behave dynamically to obtain extra information in costs distribution and in the evaluation of the effects of anomalies; and the method is particularly relevant when the dynamic behaviour of the components needs to be contemplated.

Previous FDD studies have mainly concentrated on the model performance, while fewer studies have examined the chiller fault action mechanism. This paper, therefore, proposes a method that can conduct both fault diagnosis and fault action mechanism explanation of building chillers. The method is data-driven-based and can be trained by system operational data based on the classification based on association (CBA) algorithm. Also, it is qualitatively based because system operational rules can be extracted from the diagnostic model by association rule mining. The fault diagnosis process and the fault action mechanism on the chiller system can be then understood by rule interpretation. The experimental chiller data of ASHRAE RP-1043 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the CBA-based fault diagnosis model can well identify seven common chiller faults with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 90.15%. In this work, the key rules of each fault are extracted and visualized. The mined rules can be well interpreted by domain knowledge, and the action mechanisms of seven faults are concluded.

First, the deterioration trend of a BF is analyzed and the deterioration degree is calculated on a long time scale.

Computed Tomography (CT)-based radiomic approaches calculate quantitative features of tumour heterogeneity at a mesoscopic level, regardless of macroscopic areas of hypo-dense (i.e., cystic/necrotic), hyper-dense (i.e., calcified), or intermediately dense (i.e., soft tissue) portions. Method: With the goal of achieving the automated sub-segmentation of these three tissue types, we present here a two-stage computational framework based on unsupervised Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) techniques. No existing approach has specifically addressed this task so far. Our tissue-specific image sub-segmentation was tested on ovarian cancer (pelvic/ovarian and omental disease) and renal cell carcinoma CT datasets using both overlap-based and distance-based metrics for evaluation. Results: On all tested sub-segmentation tasks, our two-stage segmentation approach outperformed conventional segmentation techniques: fixed multi-thresholding, the Otsu method, and automatic cluster number selection heuristics for the K-means clustering algorithm. In addition, experiments showed that the integration of the spatial information into the FCM algorithm generally achieves more accurate segmentation results, whilst the kernelised FCM versions are not beneficial. The best spatial FCM configuration achieved average Dice similarity coefficient values starting from 81.94±4.76 and 83.43±3.81 for hyper-dense and hypo-dense components, respectively, for the investigated sub-segmentation tasks. Conclusions: The proposed intelligent framework could be readily integrated into clinical research environments and provides robust tools for future radiomic biomarker validation.","2020-05-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","103751","","","120","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Computed tomography; Ovarian cancer; Radiomics; Renal cell carcinoma; Tissue-specific segmentation; Unsupervised fuzzy clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we develop a cluster analysis method for anomaly detection. The proposed method consolidates the building automation system data into a small number of distinct patterns of operation. These distinct patterns help energy managers discover and interpret anomalies through visualization of these patterns. The method was demonstrated with a year’s worth of building automation system data from 247 thermal zones and an air handling unit. Anomalies associated with zone temperature and airflow control were identified in about one-third of these zones. At the air handling unit-level, we identified anomalies related with three different faults: the use of economizer mode with perimeter heating, and leaky outdoor and return air dampers. The use of economizer mode with perimeter heating affected 39% to 52% of the total operation period and caused the outdoor air damper to remain fully open and the heat recovery unit to remain off during most of the heating season.","2020-12-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","110445","","","228","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Air handling units; Building automation system; Cluster analysis; Variable air volume terminal units","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Laser absorption diagnostics are an important means to study these processes, but are challenging to implement due to the extreme temperatures and pressures present in the system. Here, we combine broadband high-resolution dual-comb spectroscopy with an advanced spectral absorption database and a new means for baseline-free absorption spectroscopy analysis to enable measurements of temperature and water vapor concentration in the core of an entrained flow gasifier operating at up to 1700 K and 15 bar. The dual-comb spectrometer measures the absorption of water vapor from 6800 to 7150 cm−1 with a point spacing of 0.0067 cm−1. The bandwidth is helpful for resolving the complex, congested absorption fingerprint of water vapor that is used to determine the species concentrations and temperature. We interpret the spectrum with absorption models based on a database measured under carefully controlled high-temperature conditions with the dual-comb spectrometer. The database includes the pressure broadening, shift, and temperature dependence of these parameters for water vapor in argon, which is the gasifier bath gas. Finally, fitting the absorption model to the data is enabled by modified free induction decay analysis, which is an approach for quantitatively obtaining species and temperature information without determining the baseline intensity of the spectrometer. The baseline-free approach is crucial to success in this environment, where there are no non-absorbing regions of the spectrum to anchor the normalization of the laser intensity as in traditional direct absorption spectroscopy. We demonstrate good agreement with temperatures measured on the reactor core via optical pyrometry, and show that water vapor concentrations in the reactor core did not reach the expected system set points during some experiments.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","1561-1569","","1","38","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Absorption spectroscopy; Cepstral analysis; Dual-comb spectroscopy; Gasification; Modified free-induction decay spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outlier detection in such a context is a challenging problem because both the individual behavior of the parameters and the dynamic correlation between them are important. To address this problem, recent work has focused on multivariate functional depth to identify the outliers in a given dataset. However, most previous approaches fail when the outlyingness manifests itself in curve shape rather than curve magnitude. In this paper, we propose identifying outliers in multivariate functional data by a method whereby different outlying features are captured based on mapping functions from differential geometry. In this regard, we extract shape features reflecting the outlyingness of a curve with a high degree of interpretability. We conduct an experimental study on real and synthetic datasets and compare the proposed method with functional-depth-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method, combined with state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithms, can outperform the functional-depth-based methods.

Phosphor coatings were applied to the combustion chamber post and to three vertically oriented stripes on one combustion chamber window.

The LSTM has shown promise for interpreting computed tomography (CT) in lung screening protocols. Yet, traditional image-based LSTM models ignore interval differences, while recently proposed interval-modeled LSTM variants are limited in their ability to interpret temporal proximity. Meanwhile, clinical imaging acquisition may be irregularly sampled, and such sampling patterns may be commingled with clinical usages. In this paper, we propose the Distanced LSTM (DLSTM) by introducing time-distanced (i.e., time distance to the last scan) gates with a temporal emphasis model (TEM) targeting at lung cancer diagnosis (i.e., evaluating the malignancy of pulmonary nodules). Briefly, (1) the time distance of every scan to the last scan is modeled explicitly, (2) time-distanced input and forget gates in DLSTM are introduced across regular and irregular sampling sequences, and (3) the newer scan in serial data is emphasized by the TEM. The DLSTM algorithm is evaluated with both simulated data and real CT images (from 1794 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) patients with longitudinal scans and 1420 clinical studied patients). Experimental results on simulated data indicate the DLSTM can capture families of temporal relationships that cannot be detected with traditional LSTM. Cross-validation on empirical CT datasets demonstrates that DLSTM achieves leading performance on both regularly and irregularly sampled data (e.g., improving LSTM from 0.6785 to 0.7085 on F1 score in NLST). In external-validation on irregularly acquired data, the benchmarks achieved 0.8350 (CNN feature) and 0.8380 (with LSTM) on AUC score, while the proposed DLSTM achieves 0.8905. In conclusion, the DLSTM approach is shown to be compatible with families of linear, quadratic, exponential, and log-exponential temporal models. The DLSTM can be readily extended with other temporal dependence interactions while hardly increasing overall model complexity.","2020-10-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","101785","","","65","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Distanced LSTM; Longitudinal; Lung cancer diagnosis; Temporal Emphasis Model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study is to design new quantitative ultrasound (QUS) biomarkers integrated from pathological information of tissue microstructure, conventional B-mode imaging-based acoustic and morphological features, and strain imaging-based tissue elasticity features for detecting cancer more effectively. We also develop simulation models to evaluate the estimation accuracy of effective scatterer diameter (ESD), a characteristic parameter of tissue pathology. The proposed biomarkers are designed by optimally integrating 2 QUS indirect pathology (iPATH) parameters with 27 QUS radiology and tissue elasticity (RATE) parameters. To determine effective biomarkers, several techniques are employed: a wrapper-based feature reduction technique in the original feature domain as well as in the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) domain, and a genetic algorithm-based feature weighting technique. Simulation phantoms determining the accuracy of the ESD estimation algorithm and explaining the increasing trend of ESD with the carcinogenic transformation of normal tissue are created in MATLAB and analyzed using Field II. The resulting average mean absolute percentage error of the ESD estimation algorithm on the simulation phantoms is 4.06%, proving its efficacy. On 139 in-vivo patient data, the three techniques yield accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity within the range of 97.84–99.28%, 97.84–100%, and 95.45–98.95%, respectively.

Compared with the EPDM in homogeneous model, two extra contributions, diffusion and interface entropy production (DifE, IntE), are added in EPDMS. Then, EPDMS was validated by experiments of a pump-turbine in pump mode at three off-design conditions. The improved numerical model is more accurate in capturing the typical cavitation points, while the original one is obviously lower due to poor consideration of phase interaction. Therefore, the loss predicted by EPDMS is more rational. A detailed comparison among four overlapping items of EPDM and EPDMS was performed. It shows that these items merely interpret the accumulative effect of cavitation on the flow, while as a key part of EPDMS, IntE is closely related to the evolution of cavitation.

In addition, the CNN technique is used to extract features from each Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) in order to address the deficiency in extracting features from a single source and to achieve an effective and efficient fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under different environments and states. The value of parameter K of the VMD-DCNNs model is optimized by considering time complexity and generalization ability of the model. Lastly, bearing experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the VMD-DCNNs in diagnosing fault under different conditions.

Using two LAMP primer sets, the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified in a single-tube reaction, and detected with the diagnosis results easily interpreted by LFB. In presence of FITC (fluorescein)-/digoxin- and biotin-labeled primers, mRT-LAMP produced numerous FITC-/digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons, which were determined by LFB through immunoreactions (FITC/digoxin on the duplex and anti-FITC/digoxin on the test line of LFB) and biotin/treptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and strptavidin on the polymerase nanoparticle). The accumulation of nanoparticles leaded a characteristic crimson band, enabling multiplex analysis of ORF1ab and N gene without instrumentation. The limit of detection (LoD) of COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB was 12 copies (for each detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33 oropharynx swab samples collected from COVID-19 patients), and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96 oropharynx swab samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients). The total diagnostic test can be completed within 1 h from sample collection to result interpretation. In sum, the COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB assay is a promising tool for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections in frontline public health field and clinical laboratories, especially from resource-poor regions.","2020-10-15","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","112437","","","166","","Biosensors and Bioelectronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Lateral flow biosensor; Multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification; Rapid diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we propose a rule-based system to differentiate thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections using deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of three components: (1) automatically locating tissue regions in the whole slide images (WSIs), (2) splitting located tissue regions into patches and classifying each patch into predefined categories using convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (3) integrating predictions of all patches to form the final diagnosis with a rule-based system. To be specific, we fine-tune the InceptionV3 model for thyroid patch classification by replacing the last fully connected layer with three outputs representing the patch's probabilities of being benign, uncertain, or malignant. Moreover, we design a rule-based protocol to integrate patches’ predictions to form the final diagnosis, which provides interpretability for the proposed system. On 259 testing slides, the system correctly predicts 95.3% (61/64) of benign nodules and 96.7% (148/153) of malignant nodules, and classify 16.2% (42/259) slides as uncertain, including 19 benign and 16 malignant slides, which are a sufficiently small number to be manually examined by pathologists or fully processed through permanent sections. Besides, the system allows the localization of suspicious regions along with the diagnosis. A typical whole slide image, with 80, 000 × 60, 000 pixels, can be diagnosed within 1 min, thus satisfying the time requirement for intraoperative diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply deep learning to diagnose thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections.

Automatic PCa classification of digitized H&E slides has been developed before, but no attempts have been made to classify PCa using additional tissue stains registered to H&E. In this paper, we demonstrate that using H&E, Ki67 and p63-stained (3-stain) tissue improves PCa classification relative to H&E alone. We also show that we can infer PCa-relevant Ki67 and p63 information from the H&E slides alone, and use it to achieve H&E-based PCa classification that is comparable to the 3-stain classification. Reported improvements apply to classifying benign vs. malignant tissue, and low grade (Gleason group 2) vs. high grade (Gleason groups 3,4,5) cancer. Specifically, we conducted four classification tasks using 333 tissue samples extracted from 231 radical prostatectomy patients: regression tree-based classification using either (i) 3-stain features, with a benign vs malignant area under the curve (AUC = 92.9%), or (ii) real H&E features and H&E features learned from Ki67 and p63 stains (AUC = 92.4%), as well as deep learning classification using either (iii) real 3-stain tissue patches (AUC = 94.3%) and (iv) real H&E patches and generated Ki67 and p63 patches (AUC = 93.0%) using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. Classification performance was assessed with Monte Carlo cross validation and quantified in terms of the Area Under the Curve, Brier score, sensitivity, and specificity.

For example, within mental health, a real-time patient monitoring system capable of accurately inferring a patient’s emotional state could help doctors make an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Such interventions could be vital in terms of ensuring a higher quality of life for the patient involved. To make such tools a reality, the associated machine learning systems need to be fast, robust and generalisable. In this regard, we present herein, a novel emotion recognition system consisting of the shallowest realisable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. We draw insights from visualisations of the trained filter weights and the facial action unit (FAU) activations, i. e. the inputs to the model, of the participants featured in the in-the-wild, spontaneous video-chat sessions of the SEWA corpus. Further, we demonstrate the generalisablity of this approach on the German, Hungarian, and Chinese cultures available in this corpus. The obtained cross-cultural performance is a testimony to the universality of FAUs in expression and understanding of the human affective behaviours. These learnings were moderately consistent with the human perception of emotional expression. The practicality of the proposed approach is also demonstrated in another key healthcare applications; pain intensity prediction. Key results from these experiments highlight the transparency of the shallow CNN structure. As FAU can be extracted in near real-time, and because the models we developed are exceptionally shallow, this study paves the way for a robust, cross-cultural, end-to-end, in-the-wild, explainable real-time affect and pain prediction, that is value- and time-continuous.","2020-11-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","102347","","6","57","","Information Processing & Management","I see it in your eyes","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Healthcare; Feature selection; Affect recognition; Explainable; In-the-wild; Real-time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thermal alterations of lead white paint films are often observed during Raman spectroscopy, although the origin of heating has not yet been exhaustively explained. Here, we approach the interpretation of this phenomenon through the preparation of high- (analytes) and low-grade (art pigment) lead white films, thorough compositional and structural characterizations, measurement of the optical parameters, and online temperature measurements during Raman spectroscopy excited at 1064 nm. Spectra and associated temperature profiles were achieved using a system equipped with an online thermal sensor. The data collected show the crucial importance of the degree of purity in heat generation upon laser exposure. Due to their higher content of Fe2O3 inclusions, low-grade films (150−250 ppm against 50 ppm of high-grade) showed absorption coefficients five times higher than high-grades films, and temperature rises up to 80−100 °C upon 207 W/cm2 irradiation and 25 s exposure. Optical absorption and heating of low-grade films determined weaker signals and higher backgrounds in the Raman spectra, whose origin was ascribed to luminescence of Fe2O3 inclusions. Moreover, the spectral and thermal influence of the substrate was also investigated thus achieving a complete picture of the photothermal behavior of lead-white art pigments during Raman spectroscopy.","2020-12-15","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","128958","","","325","","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Scattering; Raman; Laser heating; Lead carbonate; Optical properties; Thermoelectric sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate gliomas grading is crucial for prognosis assessment and optimal treatment on the part of the patient. This study aims to develop and validate a pretreatment MRI-based noninvasive machine learning radiomics model for preoperatively grading glioma, and to simultaneously interpret the radiomics features used in the model. Firstly, wavelet transform and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtering are used during image preprocessing and a total of 1024 quantitative features are extracted from the region of interest (ROI) of the tumor, which is manually delineated on the largest slice of MRI images. Then, feature selection is performed by Pearson correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Finally, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is built to carry out the glioma grading, and Shapley value is used to quantitatively interpret and reveal the important features contributing to grading. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that XGBoost is effective and efficient for the diagnosis of glioma. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are 0.83, 0.86, 0.81, 0.86, respectively. These results add evidence of the important role of radiomics model based on only one representative MRI image in preoperatively grading glioma.

The generalized expressions to the tidal periods are derived and validated through the operational mechanism of a planetary gearbox. The tidal periods are incorporated into simulated signal models so that the unique influences to the vibration responses of a planetary gearbox are revealed. Some previously uncleared and uninterpreted fault-related sidebands can, therefore, be properly interpreted. Moreover, a tidal period is proved to be a minimized time duration that embraces complete fault induced information. Through simple statistical analysis of experimental data under different operating speeds, a minimum required data length for proper fault diagnosis is recommended based on the analysis of a tidal period.

This study's goal is to present the pulsatile blood flow conduct through four different levels of constrictions, i.e., healthy, 25%, 50%, and 75% in human left coronary arteries. Methods Using CT scan data of a healthy person, the two-dimensional coronary model is constructed. A non-Newtonian Carreau model is used to study the maximum flow velocity, streamline effect, and maximum Wall Shear Stress at the respective constricted areas over the entire cardiac cycle. Finite Volume Method is executed for solving the governing equations. The fluctuating Wall Shear Stress (WSS) at different levels was assessed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Results The comparative study of the diseased arteries showcases that at the systolic phase, the 75% blocked artery attains the maximum velocity of 0.14 m/s and 0.53 m/s at t=0.005 s and t=0.115 s, respectively. While the maximum velocity takes a significant drop at t=0.23 s and t=0.345 s, this marks the diastolic phase. The streamline contour showcased the blood flow conduct at different phases of the cardiac cycle. At the peak systolic phase, a dense flow separation was observed near the blocked regions. It highlights the disturbed flow in that particular region. The most severely diseased artery acquires the maximum WSS of 18.81 Pa at the peak systolic phase, i.e., at t=0.115 s. Conclusions The computational study of the hemodynamic parameters can aid in the early anticipation of the degree of the severity of the diseased arteries. This study, in a way, could benefit doctors/surgeons to plan an early treatment/surgery on the grounds of the severity of the disease. Thus, a before time prognosis could restrain the number of deaths caused due to Coronary Artery Disease.","2020-12-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","105661","","","197","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","Numerical computation of blood hemodynamic through constricted human left coronary artery","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Computational fluid dynamics; Coronary artery; Human heart; Numerical methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, deep learning has been a fast-growing field and has shown promising results for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in interpreting condition monitoring signals such as vibration, acoustic emission, and pressure due to its capacity to mine complex representations from raw data. This paper provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art deep learning-based PHM frameworks. It emphasizes on the most recent trends within the field and presents the benefits and potentials of state-of-the-art deep neural networks for system health management. In addition, limitations and challenges of the existing technologies are discussed, which leads to opportunities for future research.","2020-10-15","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","107929","","","163","","Measurement","Deep learning for prognostics and health management","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Prognostics and health management; Fault diagnosis; Anomaly detection; Domain adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a recent study demonstrates that medical deep learning systems can be compromised by carefully-engineered adversarial examples/attacks with small imperceptible perturbations. This raises safety concerns about the deployment of these systems in clinical settings. In this paper, we provide a deeper understanding of adversarial examples in the context of medical images. We find that medical DNN models can be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks compared to models for natural images, according to two different viewpoints. Surprisingly, we also find that medical adversarial attacks can be easily detected, i.e., simple detectors can achieve over 98% detection AUC against state-of-the-art attacks, due to fundamental feature differences compared to normal examples. We believe these findings may be a useful basis to approach the design of more explainable and secure medical deep learning systems.","2021-02-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","107332","","","110","","Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Medical image analysis; Adversarial attack; Adversarial example detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deep learning approaches have shown promising performance as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, but their black-box behaviour hinders clinical application. We propose DR|GRADUATE, a novel deep learning-based DR grading CAD system that supports its decision by providing a medically interpretable explanation and an estimation of how uncertain that prediction is, allowing the ophthalmologist to measure how much that decision should be trusted. We designed DR|GRADUATE taking into account the ordinal nature of the DR grading problem. A novel Gaussian-sampling approach built upon a Multiple Instance Learning framework allow DR|GRADUATE to infer an image grade associated with an explanation map and a prediction uncertainty while being trained only with image-wise labels. DR|GRADUATE was trained on the Kaggle DR detection training set and evaluated across multiple datasets. In DR grading, a quadratic-weighted Cohen’s kappa (κ) between 0.71 and 0.84 was achieved in five different datasets. We show that high κ values occur for images with low prediction uncertainty, thus indicating that this uncertainty is a valid measure of the predictions’ quality. Further, bad quality images are generally associated with higher uncertainties, showing that images not suitable for diagnosis indeed lead to less trustworthy predictions. Additionally, tests on unfamiliar medical image data types suggest that DR|GRADUATE allows outlier detection. The attention maps generally highlight regions of interest for diagnosis. These results show the great potential of DR|GRADUATE as a second-opinion system in DR severity grading.","2020-07-01","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:45","101715","","","63","","Medical Image Analysis","DR|GRADUATE","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Uncertainty; Explainability; Diabetic retinopathy grading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most traditional methods rely on the question-concept matrix empirically designed by experts. However, the expert concepts are expensive and inter-overlapping in their constructions, leading to ambiguous explanations. With the intuition that each student can master a part of the knowledge involved in all questions, in this paper, we propose a novel learning-based model for student knowledge diagnosis, dubbed Meta-knowledge Dictionary Learning (metaDL). MetaDL aims to learn a meta-knowledge dictionary from student responses, where any knowledge entity (e.g., student, question or expert concept) is a linear combination of a few atoms in the meta-knowledge dictionary. The resultant problem could be effectively solved by developing the alternating direction method of multipliers. This study has three innovations: learning independent meta-knowledges instead of traditional complex concepts, sparely representing knowledge entity instead of densely weighted representation, and interpreting expert concepts with the resulting meta-knowledges. For evaluation, the diagnosis results from metaDL are used to group students and predict responses on two public datasets and a private dataset from our institution. The experiment results show that metaDL delivers an effective student knowledge diagnosis and then results in good performances on the two applications in comparison with other methods. This technique could provide significant insights into student’s knowledge state and facilitate the progress on personalized education.","2020-10-12","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","2021-06-05 17:24:46","106290","","","205","","Knowledge-Based Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cognitive diagnosis; Dictionary learning; Latent knowledge analysis; Student clustering and classification; Student knowledge based-system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
