As these three cancer types constitute more than 90% of diagnoses, we demonstrate that the majority of dermatopathology work is amenable to automatic machine analysis. A major feature of this work is characterising the tissue by classifying it into 12 meaningful dermatological classes, including hair follicles, sweat glands as well as identifying the well-defined stratified layers of the skin. These provide highly interpretable outputs as the network is trained to represent the problem domain in the same way a pathologist would. While this enables a high accuracy of whole image classification (93.6-97.9%), by characterising the full context of the tissue we can also work towards performing routine pathologist tasks, for instance, orientating sections and automatically assessing and measuring surgical margins. This work seeks to inform ways in which future computer aided diagnosis systems could be applied usefully in a clinical setting with human interpretable outcomes.","2021-02-01","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:02","101915","","","68","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\SKR5GB3L\S1361841520302796.html","","","Deep learning; Skin cancer; Machine learning; Classification; Segmentation; Computational Pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) framework that automatically identifies NATM construction works using low-cost site surveillance images. The framework adopts the Bayesian statistics to combine the prior NATM construction knowledge with the visual evidence extracted by deep learning (DL) based computer vision models. The analysis results of Site CCTV surveillance videos of four NATM tunneling projects are presented to demonstrate its ability (i) to label NATM work cycles from the work timeline, (ii) to identify NATM work categories inside each work cycle, and (iii) to estimate the degree of plan-work deviation at the construction cycle level.

Several models have placed strong emphasis on temporal attention mechanisms and decay factors as a means to include highly temporally relevant information regarding the recency of medical event occurrence while facilitating medical code-level interpretability. In this study we utilise such models with a large Electronic Patient Record (EPR) data set consisting of diagnoses, medication, and clinical text data for the purpose of adverse drug event (ADE) prediction. The first contribution of this work is an empirical evaluation of two state-of-the-art medical-code based models in terms of objective performance metrics for ADE prediction on diagnosis and medication data. Secondly, as an extension of previous work, we augment an interpretable deep learning architecture to permit numerical risk and clinical text features and demonstrate how this approach yields improved predictive performance compared to the other baselines. Finally, we assess the importance of attention mechanisms in regards to their usefulness for medical code-level and text-level interpretability, which may facilitate novel insights pertaining to the nature of ADE occurrence within the health care domain.","2020-09-01","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:02","101942","","","109","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\KKDZN7T3\S0933365719311546.html","","","Deep learning; Explainable AI; Adverse drug events; Medical records; Text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as ‘weight low’ or ‘glucose level high’ while describing symptoms. This paper proposes an approach by performing data-driven learning of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule bases for clinical decision support. The approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, capable of capturing simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the framework of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), thereby further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents. Experimental studies on popular medical data benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed work is able to learn compact rule bases involving simple rule antecedents, with statistically better or comparable performance to those achieved by state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-05 17:50:02","101986","","","111","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\FUGU63QK\S0933365720312513.html","","","Clinical decision support; Fuzzy rule-based systems; Medical diagnostic systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This allows for a better decision support by considering the anticipated time-to-failure and thus promises to reduce costs. Here a common baseline may be derived by fitting a probability density function to past lifetimes and then utilizing the (conditional) expected remaining useful life as a prognostic. This approach finds widespread use in practice because of its high explanatory power. A more accurate alternative is promised by machine learning, where forecasts incorporate deterioration processes and environmental variables through sensor data. However, machine learning largely functions as a black-box method and its forecasts thus forfeit most of the desired interpretability. As our primary contribution, we propose a structured-effect neural network for predicting the remaining useful life which combines the favorable properties of both approaches: its key innovation is that it offers both a high accountability and the flexibility of deep learning. The parameters are estimated via variational Bayesian inferences. The different approaches are compared based on the actual time-to-failure for aircraft engines. This demonstrates the performance and superior interpretability of our method, while we finally discuss implications for decision support.","2019-10-01","2021-06-05 17:50:03","2021-06-15 08:10:08","2021-06-05 17:50:02","113100","","","125","","Decision Support Systems","Forecasting remaining useful life","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\LM7ATEB6\S0167923619301290.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\YZHNIRNI\Kraus and Feuerriegel - 2019 - Forecasting remaining useful life Interpretable d.pdf","","","Neural networks; Deep learning; Machine learning; Forecasting; Remaining useful life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We set the experiments on data of chronic heart patients from Almazov Medical Research Center.
