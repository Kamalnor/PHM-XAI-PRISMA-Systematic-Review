However, early diagnosis and treatment can save life. Although, CT scan imaging is best imaging technique in medical field, it is difficult for doctors to interpret and identify the cancer from CT scan images. Therefore computer aided diagnosis can be helpful for doctors to identify the cancerous cells accurately. Many computer aided techniques using image processing and machine learning has been researched and implemented. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the various computer-aided techniques, analyzing the current best technique and finding out their limitation and drawbacks and finally proposing the new model with improvements in the current best model. The method used was that lung cancer detection techniques were sorted and listed on the basis of their detection accuracy. The techniques were analyzed on each step and overall limitation, drawbacks were pointed out. It is found that some has low accuracy and some has higher accuracy but not nearer to 100%.

One of the commonly used methodologies is the x-ray screening. This examination very often help to diagnose some diseases of chest organs. The most frequent cause of wrong diagnosis lie in the radiologist’s difficulty in interpreting the presence of lungs carcinoma in chest X-ray. In such circumstances, an automated approach could be highly advantageous as it provides important help in medical diagnosis. Methods In this paper we propose a new classification method of the lung carcinomas. This method start with the localization and extraction of the lung nodules by computing, for each pixel of the original image, the local variance obtaining an output image (variance image) with the same size of the original image. In the variance image we find the local maxima and then by using the locations of these maxima in the original image we found the contours of the possible nodules in lung tissues. However after this segmentation stage we find many false nodules. Therefore to discriminate the true ones we use a probabilistic neural network as classifier. Results The performance of our approach is 92% of correct classifications, while the sensitivity is 95% and the specificity is 89.7%. The misclassification errors are due to the fact that network confuses false nodules with the true ones (6%) and true nodules with the false ones (2%). Conclusions Several researchers have proposed automated algorithms to detect and classify pulmonary nodules but these methods fail to detect low-contrast nodules and have a high computational complexity, in contrast our method is relatively simple but at the same time provides good results and can detect low-contrast nodules. Furthermore, in this paper is presented a new algorithm for training the PNN neural networks that allows to obtain PNNs with many fewer neurons compared to the neural networks obtained by using the training algorithms present in the literature. So considerably lowering the computational burden of the trained network and at same time keeping the same performances.","2018-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","173-180","","","161","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GDVZ6GAL\S0169260718300737.html","","","Biomedical image processing; Automatic pathology recognition; Chest X-ray screening; Probabilistic neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An overlapped grouping strategy with biological interpretability is proposed, which highlights the importance of gene groups from the minority classes. By using the conditional mutual information, the gene significance within each group is evaluated and the data-driven weights are constructed. Based on the grouping strategy and constructed weights, a regularized adaptive multinomial regression is presented and the solving algorithm is developed, which can not only select the important gene groups for each class in performing multi-class classification, but also adaptively select important genes within each group.

An ultrasound is also referred to as ultrasonography, which is a device that is used to create images of the inner body by using high frequency sound waves. Ultrasound is an imaging technique which is noninvasive, nonradioactive and also inexpensive and is used for diagnosis and treatment. Presence of noise in ultrasound images is a major issue as it can lead to improper diagnosis of the disease. It is very important to restore the quality of the images so as to gain information from the medical images. It is important to preserve the features of the image by reducing the noise levels. This work explains about the various kinds of noises present within the ultrasound medical images and also the filters that are used for the noise removal purpose. The noises were introduced in the ultrasound images are Salt and Pepper Noise (impulse or spike noise), Poisson noise (shot noise), Gaussian or amplifier noise and Speckle Noise. For the noise reduction from ultrasound images, a study is carried out by using Gaussian filter, bilateral filter, Order statistic filter, Mean filter and Laplacian filter for efficient noise reduction from the images. The results we obtained after performing the experiments shows the performance and comparisons of different filters supported their PSNR (Peak signal to noise ratio), MSE (Mean Square Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values.

It is important to understand the gun barrel condition during its service time and to predict the remaining useful life. In this paper, three traditional life prediction methods, including heat-based, dimension-based and velocity-based method, are summarized and proved to be insufficient for predicting the remaining useful life. A novel strain-based approach to life prediction of gun barrel is presented and analyzed theoretically, in which the strain of the outside surface of gun barrel is selected as a health index of the gun barrel. A large number of laboratory experiments on engraving small caliber projectiles have been carried out to verify the reasonability and feasibility of this strain-based method. Self-made copper and brass jacketed projectiles were pushed through a short gun barrel section under quasi-static and dynamic loading. The hoop and axial strains were measured using strain gauges and stored for analysis. Experimental results are listed as follows. (1) The measured strains do reflect the interaction between projectile and gun barrel under different test conditions. (2) Material property of jacket and diameter of projectile have influence on the external strains. (3) The jacket undergoes friction and plastic deformation during the engraving process. Effects of strain rate and thermal softening play critical roles in affecting the projectile and gun barrel interaction. This finding helps to explain that higher strains at low charges and lower strains at high charges occur to a 155 mm gun during firing practice.","2018-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","297-311","","","122","","Measurement","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\5B49FFBH\S0263224118301398.html","","","Gun barrel; Health monitoring; Life prediction; Strain; Wear and fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) has been recently described on T2-weighted MR sequences in this population and thought to be associated with neuropathologies. To date, no robust and reproducible method to assess the presence of white matter hyperintensities has been developed, perhaps explaining the current controversy over their prognostic value. The aim of this paper is to propose a new semi-automated framework to detect DEHSI on neonatal brain MR images having a particular pattern due to the physiological lack of complete myelination of the white matter. A novel method for semi- automatic segmentation of neonatal brain structures and DEHSI, based on mathematical morphology and on max-tree representations of the images is thus described. It is a mandatory first step to identify and clinically assess homogeneous cohorts of neonates for DEHSI and/or volume of any other segmented structures. Implemented in a user-friendly interface, the method makes it straightforward to select relevant markers of structures to be segmented, and if needed, apply eventually manual corrections. This method responds to the increasing need for providing medical experts with semi-automatic tools for image analysis, and overcomes the limitations of visual analysis alone, prone to subjectivity and variability. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is accurate, with excellent reproducibility and with very few manual corrections needed. Although the method was intended initially for images acquired at 1.5T, which corresponds to the usual clinical practice, preliminary results on images acquired at 3T suggest that the proposed approach can be generalized.","2018-08-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","75-94","","","48","","Medical Image Analysis","The challenge of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in neonates","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\DZSYG39H\S1361841518302809.html","","","Mathematical morphology; Max-tree representation; Neonatal brain MRI; Preterm brain MRI; Semi-automatic tissue segmentation; White matter hyperintensities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because there is no symptom exhibited in its initial phase until the disease progresses to an advanced stage. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely accessible diagnostic tool to diagnose CAD that captures abnormal activity of the heart. However, it lacks diagnostic sensitivity. One reason is that, it is very challenging to visually interpret the ECG signal due to its very low amplitude. Hence, identification of abnormal ECG morphology by clinicians may be prone to error. Thus, it is essential to develop a software which can provide an automated and objective interpretation of the ECG signal. This paper proposes the implementation of long short-term memory (LSTM) network with convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically diagnose CAD ECG signals accurately.

However, interpreting mp-MRI data which typically contains multiple unregistered 3D sequences, e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) images, is time-consuming and demands special expertise, limiting its usage for large-scale PCa screening. Therefore, solutions to computer-aided detection of PCa in mp-MRI images are highly desirable. Most recent advances in automated methods for PCa detection employ a handcrafted feature based two-stage classification flow, i.e. voxel-level classification followed by a region-level classification. This work presents an automated PCa detection system which can concurrently identify the presence of PCa in an image and localize lesions based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features and a single-stage SVM classifier. Specifically, the developed co-trained CNNs consist of two parallel convolutional networks for ADC and T2w images respectively. Each network is trained using images of a single modality in a weakly-supervised manner by providing a set of prostate images with image-level labels indicating only the presence of PCa without priors of lesions’ locations. Discriminative visual patterns of lesions can be learned effectively from clutters of prostate and surrounding tissues. A cancer response map with each pixel indicating the likelihood to be cancerous is explicitly generated at the last convolutional layer of the network for each modality. A new back-propagated error E is defined to enforce both optimized classification results and consistent cancer response maps for different modalities, which help capture highly representative PCa-relevant features during the CNN feature learning process. The CNN features of each modality are concatenated and fed into a SVM classifier. For images which are classified to contain cancers, non-maximum suppression and adaptive thresholding are applied to the corresponding cancer response maps for PCa foci localization.

This promotes emerging technologies in thermal or flame water cleaning from unspecified impurities, and firefighting by water slurry aerosols. Unfortunately, these technologies have yet to become mainstream, although they have been regarded as extremely important and promising for several years already. The fact is that there are too few experimental data on the physical processes intensifying the evaporation of water slurries in hot gaseous media. The results of such experiments with temperatures over 1000°C are virtually impossible to find. These data are so evasive due to fast-paced processes and difficulties in measuring the temperature in evaporating heterogeneous water droplets. The typical durations of high-temperature heating and evaporation do not usually exceed several seconds. In this work, we conduct experiments using a heterogeneous water droplet with a single nontransparent solid inclusion to determine the unsteady temperature field of the latter. We use an optical diagnostic technique, Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence, to study the conditions, mechanism, reasons and characteristics of water boiling leading to an explosive breakup (disintegration) of water slurry droplets. Rhodamine B acts as a fluorophore. The typical temperatures are determined in the depth of a droplet, near its free (outer) surface, and at the interface. The water temperature at the water – solid inclusion interface is shown to be higher than at the outer surface of a droplet.

Consumers are increasingly seeking serendipity in online shopping, where information clutter and preprogramed recommendation systems can make product choice frustrating or mundane. However, it is notoriously difficult to design online shopping environments that induce it. In this study, we explore how social media affordances such as obtaining access to peer-generated content and being connected to online friends can help create the right conditions for serendipity in online shopping. We supplement this analysis with an account of two individual factors that are also likely to be instrumental in a shopping context, namely, the intensity of shoppers’ information search and their aversion to risk when faced with a product choice. Our investigation relies on a conceptualization of serendipity that has two defining elements: unexpectedness and informational value. The results of an experimental study in which we manipulated an online product search environment reveal the superiority of designs that incorporate online friendships, and these results support the positive effects of search effort and risk aversion on serendipity. This study contributes by developing a theoretical framework for the analysis of serendipity and by explaining how social commerce, that is, the integration of social media and electronic commerce, can cultivate serendipity.","2019-03-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","225-235","","2","56","","Information & Management","With a little help from my friends","Social Commerce and Social Media: Behaviors in the New Service Economy","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnosticity; Disconfirmation; Diversity; Informational value; Online information search; Serendipity; Social commerce; Unexpectedness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For some players, however, overuse fosters dependency leading to negative psychosocial and health consequences. Per the American Psychiatric Association, criteria for diagnosis of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) follow an addiction model, and include characteristics such as preoccupation, tolerance, and withdrawal. Though useful, this approach lacks a focus on underlying motivations that may partially explain vulnerability to IGD. This study explored relationships among IGD symptoms and two potential risk factors: social phobia and player-avatar identification. Participants (N = 394; 50% female) were recruited from game-related internet forums and surveyed online. We tested a model in which a positive relationship between social phobia and IGD symptoms was partially mediated by stronger avatar identification. Social phobia, avatar identification, and IGD symptoms were strongly positively related, and we found modest support for mediation as proposed. Accordingly, we suggest that fundamental needs for social connection and approval are potent motivators to play, particularly for socially phobic players uncomfortable with face-to-face contact. Vicarious interactions through a gaming avatar may fulfill these needs, reinforcing stronger self-identification with the avatar, which in turn can offer players a stronger and more positive sense of self. Such influences may work synergistically to motivate increasing intensity of and preoccupation with gameplay, contributing to IGD. These results support the use of player-avatar identification in assessing risk for IGD, developing treatment options, and reaching a better understanding of how socialization and identity can be influenced by virtual interactions and accomplishments.","2017-06-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","11-15","","","71","","Computers in Human Behavior","Internet gaming disorder","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Avatar identification; Internet gaming disorder; Online gaming; Social phobia; Video game addiction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most of the theoretical investigations on rub, the structural connectivity between rotor and the stator casing is ignored and the dynamics of the rotor are studied with stator interaction as external to the system. Thus, in the present study, a coupled rotor-stator system is modelled where the vibrating rotor transmits the force to the stator structure through the bearing support and during the direct contact. The rub interaction is defined using contact mechanics based Lagrange multiplier method. The model ensures dynamic rotor-stator contact boundary and more realistic contact constraints in contrast to most of the earlier approaches. The stator thus responds through its own vibratory motion and the instantaneous clearance decides the nature of interaction between them. The stator vibration data at the casing location is explored to provide conclusive indication of the rub phenomenon. The intermittent rub interactions that are non-synchronous to rotational frequency cause the system to exhibit quasi-periodic response and the transient excitation due to impacting rotor generates natural frequencies in the system response. In the stator vibration spectrum, the presence of sub harmonic frequency components and stronger presence of harmonics of rotational frequency near the natural frequencies of the system indicate the occurrence of rub. Only low amplitude rotational frequency component is observed otherwise. Strongly correlated with rotor vibration response, the stator vibration response and its rub specific features are proposed for the rub diagnosis.","2018-08-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","392-406","","","144","","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bifurcation; Contact constraints; Coupled rotor-stator system; Lagrange multiplier; Rubbing; Stator vibration response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A working algorithm would immediately find applications in computer-aided interventions in the operating theater. Knowing the location of tool parts could help virtually augment visual faculty of surgeons, assess skills of novice surgeons, and increase autonomy of surgical robots. A surgical tool varies in appearance due to articulation, viewpoint changes, and noise. We introduce a new method for detection and pose estimation of multiple non-rigid and robotic tools in surgical videos. The method uses a rigidly structured, bipartite model of end-effector and shaft parts that consistently encode diverse, pose-specific appearance mixtures of the tool. This rigid part mixtures model then jointly explains the evolving tool structure by switching between mixture components. Rigidly capturing end-effector appearance allows explicit transfer of keypoint meta-data of the detected components for full 2D pose estimation. The detector can as well delineate precise skeleton of the end-effector by transferring additional keypoints. To this end, we propose effective procedure for learning such rigid mixtures from videos and for pooling the modeled shaft part that undergoes frequent truncation at the border of the imaged scene. Notably, extensive diagnostic experiments inform that feature regularization is a key to fine-tune the model in the presence of inherent appearance bias in videos. Experiments further illustrate that estimation of end-effector pose improves upon including the shaft part in the model. We then evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets of in-vivo sequences of non-rigid tools and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.","2018-05-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","244-265","","","46","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Part-based models; Robotic surgery; Surgical instrument detection; Surgical instrument tracking; Video-assisted minimally invasive surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we explain for the first time the possibility of using mesh phasing for distinguishing between faults on different planet gears. It has been found that, due to mesh phasing relationships, the vibration signals recorded on a planetary gearbox test rig exhibit different characteristics depending on the position of the faulty gear. These tests used localised seeded spalls giving impulsive signals, and it was found that due to the sequential mesh phasing arrangement, the timing of the fault-related impulse responses, as measured relative to the phase of the gearmesh component, depends on which planet is faulty. These timing differences can also give rise to different levels of asymmetry in the signal. This paper proposes a phase-based approach to differentiate and locate the faulty planet gear position using vibration response signals, and an indicator is developed for this purpose. With the assistance of absolute phase information, acquired through a tachometer on the planet carrier, the phase indicator is able to locate the position of the faulty gear. The approach has been applied to recorded experimental signals and it is found that the method can diagnose the position of the faulty gear effectively.","2019-02-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","12-24","","","116","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Gear diagnostics; Mesh phasing; Planetary gearbox","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This formulation is gaining interest because it naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data. Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories: the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL methods on selected problem characteristics.

Patients would be empowered by the system, which would enable them to lead their normal daily lives in their regular environment, while feeling safe, because their health state would be continuously monitored using mobile sensors and self-reporting of symptoms. When conditions occur that require medical attention, patients would be notified as to what they need to do, based on evidence-based guidelines, while their medical team would be informed appropriately, in parallel. We wanted to assess the system’s feasibility and potential effects on patients and care providers in two different clinical domains. Materials and methods We describe MobiGuide’s architecture, which embodies these objectives. Our novel methodologies include a ubiquitous architecture, encompassing a knowledge elicitation process for parallel coordinated workflows for patients and care providers; the customization of computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) by secondary contexts affecting remote management and distributed decision-making; a mechanism for episodic, on demand projection of the relevant portions of CIGs from a centralized, backend decision-support system (DSS), to a local, mobile DSS, which continuously delivers the actual recommendations to the patient; shared decision-making that embodies patient preferences; semantic data integration; and patient and care provider notification services. MobiGuide has been implemented and assessed in a preliminary fashion in two domains: atrial fibrillation (AF), and gestational diabetes Mellitus (GDM). Ten AF patients used the AF MobiGuide system in Italy and 19 GDM patients used the GDM MobiGuide system in Spain. The evaluation of the MobiGuide system focused on patient and care providers’ compliance to CIG recommendations and their satisfaction and quality of life. Results Our evaluation has demonstrated the system’s capability for supporting distributed decision-making and its use by patients and clinicians. The results show that compliance of GDM patients to the most important monitoring targets – blood glucose levels (performance of four measurements a day: 0.87±0.11; measurement according to the recommended frequency of every day or twice a week: 0.99±0.03), ketonuria (0.98±0.03), and blood pressure (0.82±0.24) – was high in most GDM patients, while compliance of AF patients to the most important targets was quite high, considering the required ECG measurements (0.65±0.28) and blood-pressure measurements (0.75±1.33). This outcome was viewed by the clinicians as a major potential benefit of the system, and the patients have demonstrated that they are capable of self-monitoring – something that they had not experienced before. In addition, the system caused the clinicians managing the AF patients to change their diagnosis and subsequent treatment for two of the ten AF patients, and caused the clinicians managing the GDM patients to start insulin therapy earlier in two of the 19 patients, based on system’s recommendations. Based on the end-of-study questionnaires, the sense of safety that the system has provided to the patients was its greatest asset. Analysis of the patients’ quality of life (QoL) questionnaires for the AF patients was inconclusive, because while most patients reported an improvement in their quality of life in the EuroQoL questionnaire, most AF patients reported a deterioration in the AFEQT questionnaire. Discussion Feasibility and some of the potential benefits of an evidence-based distributed patient-guidance system were demonstrated in both clinical domains. The potential application of MobiGuide to other medical domains is supported by its standards-based patient health record with multiple electronic medical record linking capabilities, generic data insertion methods, generic medical knowledge representation and application methods, and the ability to communicate with a wide range of sensors. Future larger scale evaluations can assess the impact of such a system on clinical outcomes. Conclusion MobiGuide’s feasibility was demonstrated by a working prototype for the AF and GDM domains, which is usable by patients and clinicians, achieving high compliance to self-measurement recommendations, while enhancing the satisfaction of patients and care providers.","2017-05-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","108-130","","","101","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clinical decision-support systems; Computer-interpretable clinical guidelines; Mobile health; Patient guidance system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During development, the initially smooth surface evolves into an elaborately convoluted pattern. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical instabilities emerging from differential growth between a faster growing outer gray matter and a slower growing inner white matter play a major role in brain morphogenesis. Previous studies assume uniform growth and stiffness; yet, recent experiments indicate that the properties of brain tissue are highly inhomogeneous. Here, we hypothesize that regionally varying developmental pathways across the brain result in nonuniform material properties at the onset of cortical folding. We establish a computational model of brain growth to explore the effects of stiffness and growth variations in gray and white matter tissue to mimic cellular processes and evolving tissue microstructure. We present an effective approach to determine critical growth values from geometrical data and systematically study the effect of inhomogeneous material properties on growth-induced primary and secondary instabilities. Our results reveal that critical growth and wavelength strongly depend on the stiffness distribution in the developing brain. Regional variations in cortical growth affect secondary instabilities and evoke highly irregular folding patterns, but characteristic wavelength and critical growth remain relatively stable. The interplay of different influential factors including cortical thickness, brain geometry, stiffness, and growth explains how primary folds are highly preserved across individuals, whereas secondary and tertiary folds vary significantly. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging data of fetal brains and ultimately enable early diagnostics of cortical malformations to improve treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, autism, spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia.","2018-02-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","31-41","","","132-133","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cortical folding; Growth; Inhomogeneous properties; Instabilities; Period-doubling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanical integrity and operation condition of energized transformers might be evaluated by employing vibration method, which is a non-destructive and economic approach. However, researchers have not yet reached a consensus on how to interpret the results of this method. A new approach has been introduced in this study in order to evaluate transformer real-time vibration signal. A detailed discussion has been provided on transformer vibration modelling and interpretation challenges of the results. Furthermore, a novel method is introduced to evaluate transformer vibration signal during short circuit contingency.

Dimension reduction is often utilized in non-parametric density and regression where similar problems occur, but has been used in only a few instances in the context of efficiency estimation. This paper explains why the problem occurs in nonparametric models of production and proposes three diagnostics for when dimension reduction might lead to more accurate estimation of efficiency. Simulation results provide additional insight, and suggest that in many cases dimension reduction is advantageous in terms of reducing estimation error. The simulation results also suggest that when dimensionality is reduced, free-disposal hull estimators become an attractive, viable alternative to the more frequently used (and more restrictive) data envelopment analysis estimators. In the context of efficiency estimation, these results provide the first quantification of the tradeoff between information lost versus improvement in estimation error due to dimension reduction.

Most of single faults have multiple propagation paths. Any local slight deviation is able to propagate, spread, accumulate and increase through system fault causal chains. It will finally result in system failure and unplanned outages or even catastrophic accidents. The key issues focus on both of how to reduce the probability of fault occurrence and decrease the loss of fault consequence. The implementation of such requirements can be studied in terms of the determination of the fault root causes, prediction of the possible consequence, and also estimation of the risk and timing of various maintenance activities, which are considered in a failure prognosis scheme. This study proposes a DBN based failure prognosis method for complex system. Not only the interaction between components, but also the influence of the layers of protection in the system is considered when the dynamic failure scenarios are analyzed. Therefore the proposed method considers multiple factors including degradation mechanism, parameter deviation, the response of the layers of protection and also the external environment. With this model, the dynamic influence diagram of the components' degradation trends can be calculated and be used to evaluate the different effects of the layers of protection quantitatively. Some key problems are also explained such as how to determine the new nodes in DBN representing the behavior of protective layers and how to update the CPT in the extended model. In the case study, the proposed method is tested on the flue gas energy recovery system (FGERS) which is widely used in the petrochemical industry to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Diabetes is a serious health problem. A variety of methods have been developed for diagnosing diabetes. The majority of these methods have been developed in a black-box manner, which cannot be used to explain the inference and diagnosis procedure. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods with high accuracy and interpretability. In this study, a Reinforcement Learning-based Evolutionary Fuzzy Rule-Based System (RLEFRBS) is developed for diabetes diagnosis. The proposed model involves the building of a Rule Base (RB) and rule optimization. The initial RB is constructed using numerical data without initial rules; after learning the rules, redundant rules are eliminated based on the confidence measure. Next, redundant conditions in the antecedent parts are pruned to yield simpler rules with higher interpretability. Finally, an appropriate subset of the rules is selected using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the RB is constructed. Evolutionary tuning of the membership functions and weight adjusting using Reinforcement Learning (RL) are used to improve the performance of RLEFRBS. Moreover, to deal with uncovered instances, it makes use of an efficient rule stretching method. The performance of RLEFRBS was examined using two common datasets: Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) and BioSat Diabetes Dataset (BDD). The experimental results show that the proposed model provides a more compact, interpretable and accurate RB that can be considered to be a promising alternative for diagnosis of diabetes.","2017-12-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","337-352","","","91","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Genetic Algorithm; Diabetes diagnosis; Evolutionary; Fuzzy Rule-Based; Reinforcement Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fault diagnosis method for centrifugal chillers is proposed based on the associative classification (AC) algorithm, which constructs an associative classifier by excavating strong rules between fault classes and physical attributes. First, association rules with significant support and high confidence values are discovered. Instead of the Apriori algorithm, FP-growth is adopted to accelerate association rule mining. Second, only association rules named class association rules (CARs) whose consequents are limited to fault classes are preserved. Third, pruned CARs are obtained by means of ranking CARs and pruning the redundant rules according to the concept of “higher rank”. Fourth, a limited number of rules are selected out of pruned CARs based on the AC algorithm to construct an associative classifier. This approach is validated using experimental centrifugal chiller data from the ASHRAE Research Project 1043 (RP-1043).

While there are a number of efficient methods to analyze individual data types, there are far less that enhance data interpretation after analysis. We present the R package Director, a dynamic visualization approach to linking and interrogating multiple levels of molecular data after analysis for clinically meaningful, actionable insights. Methods: Sankey diagrams are traditionally used to represent quantitative flows through multiple, distinct events. Regulation can be interpreted as a flow of biological information through a series of molecular interactions. Functions in Director introduce novel drawing capabilities to make Sankey diagrams robust to a wide range of quantitative measures and to depict molecular interactions as regulatory cascades. The package streamlines creation of diagrams using as input quantitative measurements identifying nodes as molecules of interest and paths as the interaction strength between two molecules. Results: Director’s utility is demonstrated with quantitative measurements of candidate microRNA-gene networks identified in an ovarian cancer dataset. A recent study reported eight miRNAs as master regulators of signature genes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Sankey diagrams generated with data from this study furthers interpretation of the miRNAs’ roles by revealing potential co-regulatory behavior in the extracellular matrix (ECM). An additional analysis identified 32 genes differentially expressed between good and poor prognosis patients in four significant pathways (FDR  ≤  0.1), three of which support a complementary role of the ECM in ovarian cancer. The resulting diagram created with Director suggest elevated levels of COL11A1, INHBA, and THBS2 — a signature feature of metastasis [1] — and decreased levels of their targeting miRNAs define poor prognosis. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a visualization approach suitable for implementation in an analysis workflow, linking multiple levels of molecular data to gain novel perspective on candidate biomarkers in a complex disease. The diagrams are dynamic, easily replicable, and rendered locally as HTML files to facilitate sharing. The R package Director is simple to use and widely available on all operating systems through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/Director) and GitHub (http://kzouchka.github.io/Director).","2018-01-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:21","129-136","","","153","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","Dynamic visualization of multi-level molecular data","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods The main objective of the present work was the validation of the technological and medical choices by healthcare professionals, in a university hospital setting. For that, eStetho has been compared with acoustic stethoscopes in two prospective studies: the PRI stéthoscope study, including more than 160 patients, and an education study, including 30 students. Results In this analysis, the eStetho system allowed us to have a correct diagnosis in 10% more cases than with an acoustic stethoscope. An improvement of good diagnoses (recognition of heart and respiratory sounds) between 20 to 30% is also observed with 30 students of the second cycle of their medical studies. Discussion Whilst conventional stethoscope auscultation is subjective, hardly sharable and interpreted by a single clinician, the characterization and identification of sounds by computer-based recording and analysis systems provide objective and early diagnostic help along with better sensitivity and reproducibility when interpreting findings.

Internal fire whirls are much more dangerous and destructive than non-whirling fires in the shaft and deserve more attention. As fires or flames consist of ions in motion, the characteristics of the magnetic field generated by a fire whirl would provide important information. The present study aims at measuring the magnetic field generated by a fire whirl and at building a simple model to explain the generated magnetic field. The physical origin of the magnetic field associated with a fire whirl is proposed, which consists in the interaction of the moving ions with the Earth’s magnetic field. It is shown that as far as the magnetic field around a fire whirl is concerned, the fire whirl is equivalent to a solenoid carrying a current Is, which is related to characteristics pertinent to the fire whirl. The vertical component of the magnetic field obtained from this model (Bzm) is compared with experimental results (Bze) acquired in fire whirls in a shaft model. The two sets of values (Bzm and Bze) are well correlated, with deviations which are reasonably acceptable.

Though early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment of the disease, immediate reaction in cases of emergency is crucial significance in saving the lives of stricken. Previous studies on patient-centric healthcare indicate that both the patient’s whereabouts and the locality of the healthcare centers play a vital role at moment of crisis. Not only it is important for a patient to be able to find the nearest healthcare points, it is also necessary for the emergency centers to know the exact location of the patient seeking for help. To this end, a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (iHeart) is proposed, which is a patient-centric healthcare system, to monitor and track the patient via a wearable device and their mobile phones. Therefore, this study aims to find healthcare professional’s opinion and to find success factors of such a system before its full implementation. A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire in Malaysia and Iran. In order to conduct the survey, a conceptual model was proposed based on DeLone and McLean Information Success Model. A total number of 323 data was collected from both countries. The results were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software. Multi-group comparison was applied to find differences in points of view from both countries. The results of this study revealed the success factors of iHeart before the full implementation. It was found that nationality plays a moderating role between some of the success factors and success of iHeart. The success of a patient-centric healthcare system is bound to the culture of a particular nation as well as to the technological advancements, facilities, and the needs of the target users, meaning that in order for a novel healthcare system to be publicly acknowledged and utilized; target users must be classified and assessed accordingly. The findings of the present study are highly beneficial to both patients suffering from Coronary Heart Disease and the healthcare providers that seek to utilize new patient-centric healthcare systems, devices, and electronic applications to rescue patients.","2018-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","753-775","","4","35","","Telematics and Informatics","Success factors in developing iHeart as a patient-centric healthcare system","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Emergency; Location-based; Mobile healthcare; Multi-group comparison; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of the experimental results, the different binding forces of PSA/anti-PSA antibody and AFP/anti-AFP antibody in the same phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) environments are analysed by comparing the affinity constant of the two antibodies and the number of antigenic determinants of the two antigens. In different electrolyte environments, the changes of the binding force of antigens-antibodies are explained by the polyelectrolyte effect and hydrophobic interaction.

In particular US imaging has been shown to be reliable in foot and ankle assessment and offers a real-time effective imaging technique that is able to reliably confirm structural changes, such as thickening, and identify changes in the internal echo structure associated with diseased or damaged tissue. Despite the advantages of US imaging, images are difficult to interpret during medical assessment. This is partly due to the size and position of the PF in relation to the adjacent tissues. It is therefore a requirement to devise a system that allows better and easier interpretation of PF ultrasound images during diagnosis. This study proposes an automatic segmentation approach which for the first time extracts ultrasound data to estimate size across three sections of the PF (rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot). This segmentation method uses artificial neural network module (ANN) in order to classify small overlapping patches as belonging or not-belonging to the region of interest (ROI) of the PF tissue. Features ranking and selection techniques were performed as a post-processing step for features extraction to reduce the dimension and number of the extracted features. The trained ANN classifies the image overlapping patches into PF and non-PF tissue, and then it is used to segment the desired PF region. The PF thickness was calculated using two different methods: distance transformation and area-length calculation algorithms. This new approach is capable of accurately segmenting the PF region, differentiating it from surrounding tissues and estimating its thickness.","2017-03-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","60-73","","","56","","Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Feature extraction; Classification; Segmentation; Plantar fascia (PF); Radial Basic Function Neural Network (RBF-NN); Speckle noise; Ultrasound (US)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The timed discrete event system brings valuable temporal information to distinguish behaviors that are non-diagnosable based solely on the clustering itself.","2017-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","1037-1042","","1","50","","IFAC-PapersOnLine","","20th IFAC World Congress","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Machine learning; Clustering; DES; Diagnosability; Situation assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of this fact, fuzzy classification rules are extensively used in classification and decision support systems for disease diagnosis. But, most of the rule mining techniques failed to generate accurate and comprehensive fuzzy rules. This paper presents a hybrid decision support system based on Rough Set Theory (RST) and Bat optimization Algorithm (BA) called RST-BatMiner. It consists of two stages. In the first stage, redundant features have been removed from the data set through RST-based QUICK-REDUCT approach. In the second stage, for each class BA is invoked to generate fuzzy rules by minimizing proposed fitness function. Further, an Ada-Boosting technique is applied to the rules generated by BA to increase the accuracy rate of generated fuzzy rules. Moreover, to generate comprehensive fuzzy rules, a new ≠ (not equal) operator along with = (equal) operator is introduced into BA encoding scheme. The proposed RST-BatMiner builds consolidated fuzzy ruleset by learning the rules associated with each class separately. The proposed RST-BatMiner is experimented on six bench-mark datasets namely Pima Indians Diabetes, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Cleveland Heart disease, iris, wine and glass, in order to validate its generalization capability. These experimental results show that except for wine dataset the proposed RST-BatMiner yields high accuracy and comprehensible ruleset when compared to other state-of-the-art bio-inspired based fuzzy rule miners and Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems (FRBCS) in the literature. In the case of wine dataset, the proposed RST-BatMiner yields second highest accuracy along with comprehensible ruleset.","2018-06-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","764-780","","","67","","Applied Soft Computing","RST-BatMiner","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diabetes diagnosis; Bat optimization; Fuzzy classification rules; Optimal ruleset; Rough Set Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plastic injection moulding and die casting systems are typical examples of such manufacturing systems where the parts are produced by repeating the same sequence of steps that make up a manufacturing cycle. For each cycle, similarly structured data is generated. In this work a method for systematic data analysis for cyclic manufacturing processes is presented. The proposed data-analysis method integrates well-known heuristic algorithms, i.e., decision trees and clustering, with the purpose of identifying types of faulty operating conditions. The result of the analysis is an interpretable model for decision support that can be used for fault identification, to search for root causes, and to develop prognostic systems. A holistic approach of applying the proposed data-analysis method, along with suggestions and guidelines for implementation, is presented.

The LIPAc is a 125 mA 9 MeV continuous wave deuteron accelerator whose components are under construction mainly in Europe, which is being installed in Rokkasho (Japan) with the purpose of validating the IFMIF accelerator design. The beam generated by the LIPAc accelerator will be stopped by a copper cone (2.5 m long, 6.8° angle), cooled by water flowing at high velocity along its outer surface. This piece is surrounded by a shield made of iron and low Z materials for attenuating the neutron and gamma radiation originated by the interaction of the deuterons with the copper. It incorporates dedicated diagnostics for beam dump monitoring: accelerometers for detection of localized heating due to incorrect alignment of the beam and ionization chambers, which ensure that the deuteron beam footprint remains within the beam dump design limits. A lead shutter has been designed to be inserted in the beam tube during beam-off periods to stop the gamma radiation from the activated copper cone escaping through the beam tube, allowing access inside the accelerator vault. The junction of the beam dump to the beam tube has a special design to allow its remote disconnection, enabling the end of life decommissioning operations of the facility. The design and material selection of the beam dump and neighboring elements are driven by a maintenance-free requirement after a short period of operations, as the cartridge activation precludes any maintenance activities in the beam dump and neighboring elements downstream the lead shutter.

Three diagnostic variables, namely, the wind-farm induced effective surface roughness, the wake viscosity and the wake-expansion coefficient are computed using the LES-generated database and are used to characterize the flow. Computation of the diagnostic variables is relevant to the wind-energy community in different contexts ranging from parametrization of wind farms in weather and climate models, to wind-farm design and optimization based on wake-models and eddy-viscosity type Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solvers.

Previous destructive methodologies applied force to the root in an uneven manner; thus, the associated experiments could not truly assess the mechanical behavior of VRF. This problem was resolved in the current study via the novel application of a bursting pressure methodology to endodontically treated maxillary central incisors and premolars. Hydrostatic pressure was applied inside the root canal through a cannula bonded to the coronal access cavity, and the apical foramen was sealed. VRFs were observed as water burst from the fractured root surface. Morphometric parameters were measured by staining and serially sectioning the roots. The bursting pressure was significantly lower in the premolars compared with that in the incisors (19.1±3.3MPa and 25.5. ±4.5MPa, respectively, p=0.001). Cracks in the roots appeared from the apex to the cement enamel junction (CEJ) (61%), apex to mid-root (26%) and mid-root to CEJ (13%), and they involved either two root surfaces (52%) or one root surface (48%) and closely resembled clinical VRF cases. Positive correlations were found between the bursting pressure and the proximal root wall thickness, whereas correlations were not observed between the bursting pressure and the buccal or lingual wall thicknesses. Statistical Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVA) models showed that the proximal wall thickness and an elliptically shaped root cross section were the variables that indicated the differences in strength between premolars, which are more prone to VRF, and maxillary central incisors, which are less prone to VRF.","2017-05-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","267-274","","","69","","Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials","Effect of root morphology on the susceptibility of endodontically treated teeth to vertical root fracture","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bursting pressure; Cracks; Morphometric parameters; Strength; Vertical root fracture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A novel additional firing strategy, based on a modified form tandem ion current (IC) signal detection system, was applied to avoid an in-cycle misfire condition. Specifically, by detecting the misfire with the IC signal and then using an additional injection and spark ignition strategy, misfire can be avoided in the current cycle by successful survival combustion. However, if the quantity of additional injection fuel is improper, a misfire may still happen even if this strategy is applied. Furthermore, the requirement for additional fuel was found to be sensitive to the primary ignition timing. Thus, the effects of different ignition timings on the combustion and emissions of the first cycle were also studied. If the additional injection occurs near top dead centre, less fuel needs to be injected to avoid misfire. Having the additional injection timing occur too early or too late were both disadvantageous for additional spark ignition. This is determined by spray condition and piston movement in the cylinder, which is explained in detail by numerical simulation in this paper. Increasing the amount of additional injection fuel can stabilise combustion, but this also increases the hydrocarbon (HC), particulate number (PN), and particulate mass (PM) emissions. If the additional spark ignition fails to cause the combustion after additional injection and ignition, the HC emissions will not dramatically increase compared with basic misfire operation, but the PM will. However, the PM emissions are still at the same level as in normal combustion because the basic misfire condition causes ultra-low PM emissions.","2018-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","55-66","","","221","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Additional injection; Additional spark ignition; Emissions; Ion current; Misfiring diagnosis; Mixture formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study is based on a system subject to competing risks due to multiple crack paths. A periodic inspection scheme is used to monitor the system health state. Each inspection returns the perfect diagnostic information: the number of cracks, corresponding crack sizes, and the system failure/working state. Based on this information, two kinds of prognostic condition indices are predicted: the average value and probability law of the system residual useful life. The associated condition-based maintenance strategies and cost models are then developed and compared with the ones whose maintenance decisions are based on diagnostic condition indices.

It has also made it possible to use eye tracking devices to explore the dynamic visual inspection and interpretation of histopathological features of tissue while pathologists review cases. Using whole slide images, the present study examined how a pathologist’s diagnosis is influenced by fixed case-level factors, their prior clinical experience, and their patterns of visual inspection. Participating pathologists interpreted one of two test sets, each containing 12 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy specimens. Cases represented four diagnostic categories as determined via expert consensus: benign without atypia, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive cancer. Each case included one or more regions of interest (ROIs) previously determined as of critical diagnostic importance. During pathologist interpretation we tracked eye movements, viewer tool behavior (zooming, panning), and interpretation time. Models were built using logistic and linear regression with generalized estimating equations, testing whether variables at the level of the pathologists, cases, and visual interpretive behavior would independently and/or interactively predict diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Diagnostic accuracy varied as a function of case consensus diagnosis, replicating earlier research. As would be expected, benign cases tended to elicit false positives, and atypia, DCIS, and invasive cases tended to elicit false negatives. Pathologist experience levels, case consensus diagnosis, case difficulty, eye fixation durations, and the extent to which pathologists’ eyes fixated within versus outside of diagnostic ROIs, all independently or interactively predicted diagnostic accuracy. Higher zooming behavior predicted a tendency to over-interpret benign and atypia cases, but not DCIS cases. Efficiency was not predicted by pathologist- or visual search-level variables. Results provide new insights into the medical interpretive process and demonstrate the complex interactions between pathologists and cases that guide diagnostic decision-making.

Both beamline designs are state of art, being a real engineering (and mechanical) challenge, due to the compactness and alignment requirements from beam dynamics, and the seismic requirements from the accelerator site. An optimized design is critical in order to reduce beam losses and production of radiation at high power beam. The present paper summarizes the mechanical design and analysis of the MEBT and Diagnostic Plate support frames, as well as their manufacturing solutions and mechanical integration with the components installed both in the MEBT and Diagnostic Plate.

Electrolyte balance has been identified as one of the most challenging subjects for medical students, but also as one of the most relevant areas to learn about according to physicians and researchers. We present a computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) model that will be used for medical training to learn how to improve the diagnosis of hyponatremia applying an expert consensus document (ECDs). Methods We used the PROForma set of tools to develop the model, using an iterative process involving two knowledge engineers (a computer science Ph.D. and a preventive medicine specialist) and two expert endocrinologists. We also carried out an initial validation of the model and a qualitative post-analysis from the results of a retrospective study (N=65 patients), comparing the consensus diagnosis of two experts with the output of the tool. Results The model includes over two-hundred “for”, “against” and “neutral” arguments that are selectively triggered depending on the input value of more than forty patient-state variables. We share the methodology followed for the development process and the initial validation results, that achieved a high ratio of 61/65 agreements with the consensus diagnosis, having a kappa value of K=0.86 for overall agreement and K=0.80 for first-ranked agreement. Conclusion Hospital care professionals involved in the project showed high expectations of using this tool for training, but the process to follow for a successful diagnosis and application is not trivial, as reported in this manuscript. Secondary benefits of using these tools are associated to improving research knowledge and existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) or ECDs. Beyond point-of-care clinical decision support, knowledge-based decision support systems are very attractive as a training tool, to help selected professionals to better understand difficult diseases that are underdiagnosed and/or incorrectly managed.","2017-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","55-64","","","103","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clinical decision support system; Computer-aided diagnosis; Clinical practice guideline; Clinical protocol; Computer-interpretable clinical guideline; Differential diagnosis; Hyponatremia; SIADH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast number of concepts ordered in hierarchies and axes, together with the lack of rules of use, complicates the functionality of SNOMED CT for coding, extracting, and analyzing the data. Defining subgroups of SNOMED CT by discipline could increase its functionality. The challenge lies in how to choose the concepts to be included in a subset from a total of over 300,000. Besides, SNOMED CT does not cover daily need, as the clinical reality is dynamic and changing. To adapt SNOMED CT to needs in a flexible way, the possibility exists to create extensions. In Catalonia, most pathology departments have been migrating from SNOMED II to SNOMED CT in a bid to advance the development of the Catalan Pathology Registry, which was created in 2014 as a repository for all the pathological diagnoses. This article explains the methodology used to: (a) identify the clinico-pathological entities and the molecular diagnostic procedures not included in SNOMED CT; (b) define the theoretical subset and microglossary of pathology; (c) describe the SNOMED CT concepts used by pathologists of 1.17 million samples of the Catalan Pathology Registry; and (d) adapt the theoretical subset and the microglossary according to the actual use of SNOMED CT.

Moreover, in many application domains, including credit rating and medical diagnosis, it is very important that the learned model is capable of understandability and interpretability. To make spectral clustering competitive in both classification rate and comprehensibility, we propose a spectral clustering method with semantic interpretation based on axiomatic fuzzy set (AFS) theory, which integrates the representation capability of AFS and the classification competence of spectral clustering (N-cut). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using real-word datasets, and the experimental results indicate that the performance of our method is comparable with that of classic spectral clustering algorithms (NJW, SM, Diffuzzy, AASC and SOM-SC) and other clustering methods, including K-means, fuzzy c-means, and MinMax K-means.

It serves as a source of second opinion that radiologists may consider in order to interpret CT images. In this work, the purpose of CAD is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary bronchitis from CT images of the lung. Methods Left and right lung fields are segmented using optimal thresholding from the lung CT images. Texture and shape features are extracted from the pathology bearing regions. A hybrid feature selection approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) combining cosine similarity and support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to select relevant features. Additionally, tandem run recruitment strategy is included in the selection activity to choose the promising features. The SVM classifier is trained using the selected features and the performance of the trained classifier is evaluated using trivial performance evaluation measures. Results The training and testing datasets used in building the classifier model are disjoint and contains 200 CT slices affected with bronchitis, 50 normal slices and 300 slices with cancer. Out of 100 features extracted from each CT slice, a subset of 60 features is used for classification. ACO with tandem run strategy yielded 81.66% of accuracy whereas ACO without tandem run yielded an accuracy of 77.52%. When all the features are used for classifier training without feature selection algorithm, an accuracy of 75.14% is achieved.

Another example is the Learner Learning Style (LLS), which is associated with the student behavior and choices during the learning process. This information can be used to identify learner behavior and learning style. We perceived, after the study of related literature, that the research field of learner diagnosis for ODL does not apply the conjoint use of LLT and LLS. In this article, we propose a model capable of integrating data generated from the behavior of students in ODL with cognitive aspects of them, such as their Learning Styles, by crossing LLT with LLS. We also propose the CPAD method (Collect, Preprocessing, Analysis, Diagnosis), which is implemented by collecting the raw data regarding learning activities, preprocessing the data into structured time sequences, analyzing the sequences regarding the learning styles and using this analysis to diagnose the learner behavior. We selected the dropout to investigate, once the dropout rate in ODL is a real problem in universities around the world. In addition, the dropout is a student decision which can be associated with previous students behaviors. We performed a study with 202 learners to evaluate if learning styles are capable of explaining aspects of the student behavior. The results suggest that Sequential/Global learning style dimension is more capable of explaining the dropout than the other dimensions. Also, we performed four classification experiments to verify how the dimensions of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model influence the learner diagnosis.

Materials and methods A set of 100 clinical 12-lead ECG tracings was selected covering both normal cases and common abnormalities. A team of 15 junior Cardiology Fellows and 15 Non-Cardiology Fellows interpreted the ECGs in 3 phases: without any diagnostic proposal, with a single diagnostic proposal (half of them intentionally incorrect), and with four diagnostic proposals (only one of them being correct) for each ECG. Self-rated confidence of each interpretation was collected. Results Availability of diagnostic proposals significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy (p<0.001). Nevertheless, in case of a single proposal (either correct or incorrect) the increase of accuracy was present in interpretations with correct diagnostic proposals, while the accuracy was substantially reduced with incorrect proposals. Confidence levels poorly correlated with interpretation scores (rho≈2, p<0.001). Logistic regression showed that an interpreter is most likely to be correct when the ECG offers a correct diagnostic proposal (OR=10.87) or multiple proposals (OR=4.43).

Alteration of its mechanical properties due to a diaphragmatic hernia contributes towards compromising its respiratory functions, leading to the need for surgical intervention to restore the physiological conditions by means of implants.

Finite Element models of healthy and repaired diaphragms are developed from diagnostic images and anatomical samples. The mechanical response of the diaphragmatic tendon is described by assuming an isotropic hyperelastic model. A similar constitutive model is used to define the mechanical behavior of the polymeric implant, while the muscular tissue is modeled by means of a three-element Hill’s model, specifically adapted to mouse muscle fibers. The Finite Element Analysis is addressed to simulate diaphragmatic contraction in the eupnea condition, allowing the evaluation of diaphragm deformation in healthy and herniated-repaired conditions. The polymeric implant reduces diaphragm excursion compared to healthy conditions. This explains the possible alteration in the mechanical functionality of the repaired diaphragm. Looking to the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic hernia in human neonatal subjects, this study suggests the implementation of alternative approaches based on the use of biological implants.","2018-10-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","33-42","","","86","","Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Constitutive modeling; Diaphragmatic hernia; Finite Element Analysis; Muscle tissue; Soft tissues mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using high-speed camera imagery in comparison with more standard methods (e.g., pressure, emission, and laser absorption spectroscopy) to measure the ignition delay time, the effect of bifurcation has been examined in this study. Experiments were performed at pressures between 0.6 and 1.2atm for temperatures between 1650 and 2040K. The equivalence ratio for all experiments was kept at a constant value of 1 with methane as the fuel. The CO2 mole fraction was varied between a value of XCO2=0.00 to 0.895. The ignition delay time was determined from three different measurements at the sidewall: broadband chemiluminescent emission captured via a photodetector, CH4 concentrations determined using a distributed feedback interband cascade laser centered at 3403.4nm, and pressure recorded via a dynamic Kistler type transducer. All methods for the ignition delay time were compared to high-speed camera images taken of the axial cross-section during combustion. Methane time-histories and the methane decay times were also measured using the laser. It was determined that the flame could be correlated to the ignition delay time measured at the side wall but that the flame as captured by the camera was not homogeneous as assumed in typical shock tube experiments. The bifurcation of the shock wave resulted in smaller flames with large boundary layers and that the flame could be as small as 30% of the cross-sectional area of the shock tube at the highest levels of CO2 dilution. Comparisons between the camera images and the different ignition delay time methods show that care must be taken in interpreting traditional ignition delay data for experiments with large bifurcation effects as different methods in measuring the ignition delay time could result in different interpretations of kinetic mechanisms and impede the development of future mechanisms.","2017-06-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","63-76","","","180","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Chemical kinetics; Shock tube; Bifurcation; CO; Ignition delay time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cosine similarity measure (CSM) and rough dependency measure (RDM) are used independently as filter evaluation functions with ant colony optimization (ACO) to select two subsets of features. The selected subsets are used to train two classifiers namely support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers using 10-fold cross validation. All the four trained classifiers are tested and the performance measures are estimated. Results CT slices of patients affected with pulmonary cancer and hamartoma are used for experimentation. From the lung parenchymal tissues of 300 CT slices, 390 nodules are extracted. The feature selection algorithms, ACO-CSM and ACO-RDM are run for different feature subset sizes. The selected features are used to train SVM and NB classifiers. From the results obtained, it is inferred that SVM classifier with the feature subsets chosen by ACO-RDM feature selection approach yielded a maximum classification accuracy of 94.36% with 38 features. Conclusion From the results, it can be clearly inferred that selecting relevant features to train the classifier has a definite impact on the performance of the classifier.","2018-09-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","1557-1567","","3","57","","Alexandria Engineering Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Support vector machine; Computer aided diagnosis; Ant colony optimization; Cosine similarity; Pulmonary hamartoma; Rough dependency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Virtual in-situ sensor calibration (VIC), a Bayesian theory based method, can improve building energy performance by calibrating erroneous sensors in working building energy systems on a large scale. Working sensors do not need to be removed nor will reference sensors need to be added, as is done in a conventional calibration. To improve the calibration accuracy, hidden factors and their negative effects on the accuracy of a VIC must be addressed properly. In this study, we define (1) prior information and (2) cancellation effects as the negative effects. The suggested VIC method is applied to a single energy system component and to a LiBr-H2O absorption refrigeration system, respectively, to discuss the two primary effects (mentioned above). In addition to adding data sets, two strategies—inclusion of local calibration and conducting repetitive prior updates—are proposed to solve the hidden factors’ issue. The case study (1) shows that the proposed local calibration with the prior updates can solve the two negative effects, thus suggesting the high calibration accuracy and (2) demonstrates that the calibrated measurements improve the accuracy of energy performance analysis for a building energy system (up to 17.82%).","2018-02-15","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","1069-1082","","","212","","Applied Energy","Hidden factors and handling strategies on virtual in-situ sensor calibration in building energy systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bayesian MCMC; Building energy systems; Building sensors; LiBr-HO refrigeration; System energy performance; Virtual in-situ sensor calibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data collected in the course of enterprise-wide operations consists of information from broadly deployed sensors and other control equipment. Interpreting such large volumes of data with limited workforce is becoming an increasingly common challenge. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely accepted procedure for summarizing data while minimizing information loss. It does so by finding new variables, the principal components (PCs) that are linear combinations of the original variables in the dataset. However, interpreting PCs obtained from many variables from a large dataset is often challenging, especially in the context of fault detection and diagnosis studies. Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) is a relatively recent technique proposed for producing PCs with sparse loadings via variance-sparsity trade-off. Using SPCA, some of the loadings on PCs can be restricted to zero. In this paper, we introduce a method to select the number of non-zero loadings in each PC while using SPCA. The proposed approach considerably improves the interpretability of PCs while minimizing the loss of total variance explained. Furthermore, we compare the performance of PCA- and SPCA-based techniques for fault detection and fault diagnosis.

Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEG without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the disease. Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones. Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7–14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age range 7–12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant features vector input of EEG on which supervised machine learning systems acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature. Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD.","2017-04-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","73-79","","","142","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","Diagnosis of autism through EEG processed by advanced computational algorithms","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Autism spectrum disorder; Diagnosis; Artificial neural networks; EEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the identification of breast cancer by investigating bilateral asymmetry is difficult to perform due to the indistinct and borderline nature of the asymmetric signs as they appear on mammograms. Methods In this study, to increase the positive-predictive value of asymmetry in mammographic screening, a novel computerized approach for the automatic localization of malignant sites of asymmetry in mammograms is proposed. The sites of anatomical correspondence between the right and left regions of each radiographic projection were extracted by means of two bilateral masking procedures, inspired by radiologists’ criteria in interpreting mammograms and based on the use of detected landmarking structures. Relative variations of spatial patterns of intensity values and of orientations of directional components within each site were quantified by combining multidirectional Gabor filters and indices of structural similarity. The localization of the sites of malignant asymmetry was performed by coupling two quadratic discriminant analysis classifiers, one for each masking procedure, that assigned the likelihood of malignancy to each site of correspondence. Results The performance of the proposed method was assessed on 94 mammographic images from two publicly available databases and containing at least one asymmetric site. Sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy levels of 0.83 (0.09), 0.75 (0.06), and 0.79 (0.04), respectively were obtained in the classification of malignant asymmetric sites vs benign/normal sites using cross-validation. In addition, a further blind test on a dataset of Full Field Digital Mammograms achieved levels of sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 0.86, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions The achieved performance indicates that the proposed system is effective in localizing sites of malignant asymmetry and it is expected to improve computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.","2017-03-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","11-18","","","140","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Breast cancer; Computer-aided diagnosis; Bilateral asymmetry; Correlation-based structural similarity; Detection of malignant sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improved analysis of data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can be used to generate alarms and signals that could provide earlier indication of WTG faults and allow operators to more effectively plan Operation and Maintenance (O&M) strategies prior to WTG failures. Several data-mining approaches, e.g. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Normal Behaviour Models (NBM) have been used for that purpose. However, practical applications are limited because of the SCADA data complexity and the lack of accuracy due to the use of SCADA data averaged over a period of 10 min for ANN training. This paper aims to propose a new pitch fault detection procedure using performance curve (PC) based NBMs. An advantage of the proposed approach is that the system consisting of NBMs and criteria, can be developed using technical specifications of studied WTGs. A second advantage is that training data is unnecessary prior to application of the system. In order to construct the proposed system, details of WTG operational states and PCs are studied. Power-generator speed (P-N) and pitch angle-generator speed (PA-N) curves are selected to set up NBMs due to the better fit between the measured data and theoretical PCs. Six case studies have been carried out to show the prognosis of WTG fault and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results illustrate that polluted slip rings and the pitch controller malfunctions could be detected by the proposed method 20 h and 13 h earlier than by the AI approaches investigated and the existing alarm system. In addition, the proposed approach is able to explain and visualize abnormal behaviour of WTGs during the fault conditions.","2017-05-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","674-688","","","105","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Condition monitoring; Normal behaviour model; Performance curves; Pitch faults; Wind turbine generator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most AE-based failure diagnosis strategies use digital signal processing and thus require the sampling of AE signals. High sampling rates are required for this purpose (e.g. 2MHz or higher), leading to streams of large amounts of data. This situation is aggravated if fine resolution and/or multiple sensors are required. These facts combine to produce bulky data, typically in the range of GBytes, for which sufficient storage space and efficient signal processing algorithms are required. This situation probably explains why, in practice, AE-based methods consist mostly in the calculation of scalar quantities such as RMS and Kurtosis, and the analysis of their evolution in time. While the scalar-based approach offers the advantage of maximum data reduction; it has the disadvantage that most part of the information contained in the raw AE signal is lost unrecoverably. This work presents a method offering large data reduction, while keeping the most important information conveyed by the raw AE signal, useful for failure detection and diagnosis. The proposed method consist in the construction of a synthetic, unevenly sampled signal which envelopes the AE bursts present on the raw AE signal in a triangular shape. The constructed signal – which we call TriSignal – also permits the estimation of most scalar quantities typically used for failure detection. But more importantly, it contains the information of the time of occurrence of the bursts, which is key for failure diagnosis. Lomb-Scargle normalized periodogram is used to construct the TriSignal spectrum, which reveals the frequency content of the TriSignal and provides the same information as the classic AE envelope. The paper includes application examples in planetary gearbox and low-speed rolling element bearing.","2017-12-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","44-58","","","97","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","Special Issue on Surveillance","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Acoustic emissions; Data reduction; Failure detection; Failure diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by an application of fault diagnosis of an emission control system, this paper proposes an approach for efficient and interpretable modeling of multichannel profile data in high-dimensional spaces. The method is based on unsupervised classification of multichannel profile data provided by several sensors related to a fault event. The final goal is to isolate fault events in a restricted number of clusters (scenarios), each one described by a reference pattern. This can provide practitioners with useful information to support the diagnosis and to find root cause. Two multilinear extensions of principal component analysis (PCA), which can analyze the multichannel profiles without unfolding the original data set, are investigated and compared to regular PCA applied to vectors generated by unfolding the original data set. The effectiveness of multilinear extensions of PCA is demonstrated using an experimental campaign carried out on an emission control system. Results of unsupervised classification show that the multilinear extension of PCA may lead to a classification with better compactness and separation of clusters.","2018-08-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-15 07:49:32","2021-06-05 17:32:22","161-169","","","122","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","Unsupervised classification of multichannel profile data using PCA","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault diagnosis; Principal component analysis; Data clustering; Unsupervised classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional machine learning algorithms are often constrained in adapting to the complex and non-linear characteristics of manufacturing systems and processes. With the rapid development of modern computational hardware, Deep Learning has emerged as a promising computational technique for dynamical system prediction due to its enhanced capability to characterize the system complexity, overcoming the shortcomings of those traditional methods. In this paper, a new approach based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, an architecture that is specialized in discovering the underlying patterns embedded in time series, is proposed to track the system degradation and consequently, to predict the RUL. The objectives of this paper are: 1) translating the raw sensor data to an interpretable health index with the aim of better describing the system health condition; and 2) tracking the historical system degradation for accurate prediction of its future health condition. Evaluation using NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Infogram was developed to extract the repetitive transients from vibration signals based on Shannon entropy. Unfortunately, the Shannon entropy is maximized for random processes and unable to quantify the repetitive transients buried in heavy random noise. In addition, the vibration signals always contain multiple intrinsic oscillatory modes due to interaction and coupling effects between machine components. Under this circumstance, high values of Shannon entropy appear in several frequency bands or high value of Shannon entropy doesn’t appear in the optimal frequency band, and the infogram becomes difficult to interpret. Thus, it also becomes difficult to select the optimal frequency band for extracting the repetitive transients from the whole frequency bands. To solve these problems, multiscale fractional order entropy (MSFE) infogram is proposed in this paper. With the help of MSFE infogram, the complexity and nonlinear signatures of the vibration signals can be evaluated by quantifying spectral entropy over a range of scales in fractional domain. Moreover, the similarity tolerance of MSFE infogram is helpful for assessing the regularity of signals. A simulation and two experiments concerning a locomotive bearing and a wind turbine gear are used to validate the MSFE infogram. The results demonstrate that the MSFE infogram is more robust to the heavy noise than infogram and the high value is able to only appear in the optimal frequency band for the repetitive transient extraction.","2018-03-15","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","312-326","","","103","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault diagnosis; Rotating machinery; Infogram; Multiscale fractional order entropy; Repetitive transients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such capability is to explain anomalous sensor readings. In our previous conference paper, we built an automated anomaly clarification service, called ClariSense, with the ability to explain sensor anomalies using social network feeds (from Twitter). In this extended work, we present an enhanced anomaly explanation system that augments our base algorithm by considering both (i) the credibility of social feeds and (ii) the spatial locality of detected anomalies. The work is geared specifically for describing small-footprint anomalies, such as vehicular traffic accidents. The original system used information gain to select more informative microblog items to explain physical sensor anomalies. In this paper, we show that significant improvements are achieved in our ability to explain small-footprint anomalies by accounting for information credibility and further discriminating among high-information-gain items according to the size of their spatial footprint. Hence, items that lack sufficient corroboration and items whose spatial footprint in the blogosphere is not specific to the approximate location of the physical anomaly receive less consideration. We briefly demonstrate the workings of such a system by considering a variety of real-world anomalous events, and comparing their causes, as identified by ClariSense+, to ground truth for validation. A more systematic evaluation of this work is done using vehicular traffic anomalies. Specifically, we consider real-time traffic flow feeds shared by the California traffic system. When flow anomalies are detected, our system automatically diagnoses their root cause by correlating the anomaly with feeds on Twitter. For evaluation purposes, the identified cause is then retroactively compared to official traffic and incident reports that we take as ground truth. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically selected explanations and ground-truth data.","2017-10-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","381-396","","","41","","Pervasive and Mobile Computing","ClariSense+","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Sensors; Anomaly detection; Credibility; Information gain; Social data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient and effective fault diagnostic is essential to minimizing scrapped wafers, reducing unscheduled equipment downtime, and consequently maintaining high production throughput and product yields. Through analyzing the equipment sensor signals as the batch process data, i.e., process timestamp×sensor×wafer, this paper firstly applies the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect the abnormal observations. In the second stage, the normal process dynamics are decomposed into different clusters by K-Means clustering. Each part of the process dynamics is further modelled by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Fault fingerprints then can be extracted by consolidating the out of control scenarios after projecting the abnormal observations into the PCA models. An empirical study is conducted in collaboration with a local IC maker in France to validate the methodology. The result shows that the proposed approach can effectively detect abnormal observations as well as automatically classify the proper fault fingerprints to give evident guidelines in explaining the known faults.","2018-07-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","972-989","","","68","","Applied Soft Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Data-driven method; Contribution plot; Fault detection and classification; Fault fingerprint extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wavelet transform is a well-known signal processing technique in fault signal diagnosis system. Most of the proposed approaches have mainly used low-level handcraft features based on wavelet transform to encode the information for different defect classes. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based framework to classify ultrasonic signals from carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with void and delamination. In our proposed algorithm, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to learn a compact and effective representation for each signal from wavelet coefficients. To yield superior results, we proposed to use a linear SVM top layer in the training process of signal classification task. The experimental results demonstrated the excellent performance of our proposed algorithm against the classical classifier with manually generated attributes. In addition, a post processing scheme is developed to interpret the classifier outputs with a C-scan imaging process and visualize the locations of defects using a 3D model representation.","2017-09-27","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","128-135","","","257","","Neurocomputing","","Machine Learning and Signal Processing for Big Multimedia Analysis","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Feature extraction; Wavelet transform; Deep convolutional neural networks; Ultrasonic signal classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A successful situation diagnosis is the result of a series of reasoning and a thought process which integrate the operator's observations, knowledge, and experiences. Simulating reasoning processes is useful for analyzing operator performance on situation diagnosis. Reasoning and other cognitive and physical response of operators are in part influenced by behavioral tendencies. This paper introduces a new capability of the ADS-IDAC dynamic PRA model to simulate the effects of different cognitive tendencies (problem-solving styles) of the operating crew. To do so a set of generic rules are defined and implemented in the operator model of the ADS-IDAC simulation platform. These rules cover three distinctly problem-solving styles, named Vagabond, Hamlet, and Garden-path operators. Each problem-solving style represents a set of behavioral or cognitive tendencies. Modeling techniques are proposed for these problem-solving styles and implemented in a new version of ADS-IDAC. A simulation case study based on an international benchmark study on HRA methods is used to demonstrate the new capabilities in partially explaining some of the crew-to-crew variability observed in the empirical study.","2020-02-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","105840","","","194","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","SI:HRA FOUNDATIONS & FUTURE","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","ADS-IDAC; Cognitive simulation; Human reliability analysis; Problem-solving style","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The monitoring principle was tested under a large experimental campaign of laser microdrilling on TiAlN ceramic coating with a low-ns green fibre laser. Key process parameters namely pulse energy, number and repetition rate were varied. The effect of side gas on the SMI signal characteristic was analysed. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was used to identify the plasma temperature and electron number density. The SMI signals were correlated to the plume size and its evolution as a function of process parameters, as well as electron number density estimated by spectroscopy.

A facile calcination treatment of melamine and SnCl2·2H2O without further processing can obtain the expected C3N4-SnO2 sensor. Specially, the SnO2 nanoparticles directly anchor onto C3N4 layer to construct a heterostructure, giving enhanced sensing properties. Compared with pure SnO2 the heterostructural C3N4-SnO2 Exhibits 22 times enhancement of sensing sensitivity as well as fast response/recovery (7s/8s). The limit of detection (LOD) of acetone can be as low as 67ppb, which is far below the concentration in exhaled breath of a diabetic and predicts a possible for diagnosis of diabetes. Such enhancement can be interpreted as the transformation of electrons from SnO2 to C3N4 layer to form an asymmetric electronic structure in the electron depletion layer of SnO2, for which few electrons can change its resistance significantly. Moreover, the large surface area of C3N4 layer provide vast adsorption sites for target gases. Importantly, SnO2 and C3N4 are low-cost, easy fabrication and eco-friendly materials, and the synthesis strategy presented here is simple, repeatable and operable, thus can be extended to build other-type metal oxides-based nanocomposites for various applications.","2017-12-01","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:23","2021-06-05 17:32:22","641-651","","","253","","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Acetone vapor sensor; CN-SnO; Heterostructure; One-step synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
