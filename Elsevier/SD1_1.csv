Digital twin is an ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis, prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty, operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed. Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based models with machine learning. The different scenarios explored yield conclusions that might be helpful for a large range of applications.","2021-06-16","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-15 08:01:43","2021-06-05 17:27:30","107614","","","155","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\KAFY6RI9\Ritto and Rochinha - 2021 - A A Digital twin, physics-based model, and machine.pdf","","","Damage identification; Digital twin; Machine learning classifier; Physical based model; Structural dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This iMBCT program, a fully online delivered intervention with asynchronous therapist support, has previously been shown to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in women treated for breast cancer and men treated for prostate cancer. Methods Eighty-two breast- and prostate cancer survivors experiencing psychological distress received 8 weeks of therapist-guided iMBCT. Primary outcomes were improvement in anxiety and depression scores from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to six-months follow-up. Clinical predictors included levels of depression and anxiety at the time of screening and at baseline, as well as time since diagnosis. Demographic predictors included age and educational level. Therapy-related predictors included working alliance, self-compassion, and five facets of mindfulness. Mixed Linear Models were employed to test the prediction effects over time. Results Higher levels of baseline depression were associated with increased treatment response in anxiety at post-treatment, and lower levels of self-compassion were associated with increased treatment response in depression at post-treatment. None of the proposed predictors significantly predicted treatment response at six-months follow-up. Conclusion The findings suggest that iMBCT can be provided for cancer survivors regardless of their age, educational level, and time since diagnosis (up to five years) and that therapeutic alliance is not crucial for treatment response. We did not identify characteristics predicting treatment response, although many factors were tested. Still, other characteristics may be predictors, and given the relatively small sample size and a large number of statistical tests, the results should be interpreted with caution.","2021-03-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:30","100365","","","23","","Internet Interventions","Internet-delivered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for anxiety and depression in cancer survivors","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Breast cancer; Anxiety; Depression; Internet-delivered therapy; Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy; Prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It allows both patients and caregivers to plan resources, time and intensity of care to provide the best possible treatment path for the patients. In this paper, by focusing on lung cancer patients, we build several survival prediction models using deep learning techniques to tackle both cancer survival classification and regression problems. We also conduct feature importance analysis to understand how lung cancer patients’ relevant factors impact their survival periods. We contribute to identifying an approach to estimate survivability that are commonly and practically appropriate for medical use. Methodologies We have compared the performance across three of the most popular deep learning architectures - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) while comparing the performing of deep learning models against traditional machine learning models. The data was obtained from the lung cancer section of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Results The deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning models across both classification and regression approaches. We obtained a best of 71.18 % accuracy for the classification approach when patients’ survival periods are segmented into classes of ‘<=6 months’,’ 0.5 – 2 years’ and ‘>2 years’ and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 13.5 % andR2 value of 0.5 for the regression approach for the deep learning models while the traditional machine learning models saturated at 61.12 % classification accuracy and 14.87 % RMSE in regression. Conclusions This approach can be a baseline for early prediction with predictions that can be further improved with more temporal treatment information collected from treated patients.

This data is used to identify mixing events at three stages of premixed combustion, i.e. mixing before reaction, mixing during reaction and mixing after reaction. A parametric study of swirl and cooling air mass flow is conducted to investigate the mutual interaction between flame and cooling air. Within the primary zone, a significant radial asymmetry of OH concentration is observed. This asymmetry is partly explained by the presence of effusion cooling air within the unburned fresh gas, leading to lowered OH concentration within local reaction zones and their post-flame equilibrium concentration.

Although traditional medical image segmentation methods have achieved certain results, this type of method is not only computationally inefficient, but also difficult to achieve fully automatic segmentation. Deep learning has a good generalization ability, which provides a new technical approach to solve the above problems. However, the following problems exist in the application of deep learning in medical image segmentation: (1) Optimization of deep learning models. The parameters of the existing deep learning model have not been well optimized; it is easy to cause wrong medical image segmentation. (2) Overfitting problem. As the number of deep learning model layers increases, it makes the deep model fit the training data easily, but its generalization performance on the test set will be poor. In view of this, in order to solve the problem of deep learning model optimization, this paper first reveals that the weight space of deep learning is not equivalent to its parameter space, and explains in detail how to optimize the deep learning model in a positive scaling invariant space. The method of mapping the derivative of the base path back to the weight, and analyzed the stochastic optimization algorithm in F space. In addition, to solve the overfitting problem of deep learning models, this paper first gives a method of self-encoding Canonical Correlation Analysis (Self-encoding CCA) to optimize both self-coding loss and correlation loss in the fine-tuning stage. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical image segmentation algorithm based on positive scaling invariant-self encoding CCA.

While many modern ECG machines provide automated measurements of the QT-interval, these automated QT values are usually correct only for a noise-free normal sinus rhythm, in which the T-wave morphology is well defined. As QT-prolonging drugs often affect the morphology of the T-wave, automated QT measurements taken under these circumstances are easily invalidated. An additional challenge is that the QT-value at risk of TdP varies with heart rate, with the slower the heart rate, the greater the risk of TdP. This paper presents an explainable algorithm that uses an understanding of human visual perception and expert ECG interpretation to automate the detection of QT-prolongation at risk of TdP regardless of heart rate and T-wave morphology. It was tested on a large number of ECGs (n=5050) with variable QT-intervals at varying heart rates, acquired from a clinical trial that assessed the effect of four known QT-prolonging drugs versus placebo on healthy subjects. The algorithm yielded a balanced accuracy of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.99, F1-score of 0.88, ROC (AUC) of 0.98, precision-recall (AUC) of 0.88, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.88. The results indicate that a prolonged ventricular repolarisation area can be a significant risk predictor of TdP, and detection of this is potentially easier and more reliable to automate than measuring the QT-interval distance directly. The proposed algorithm can be visualised using pseudo-colour on the ECG trace, thus intuitively ‘explaining’ how its decision was made, which results of a focus group show may help people to self-monitor QT-prolongation, as well as ensuring clinicians can validate its results.","2021-04-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","104281","","","131","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Explainable AI; Automated ECG interpretation; Drug-induced LQTS; Human-like algorithm; Machine perception; QT-Prolongation; Rule-based algorithm; TdP; Torsades de pointes; Visual perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of our proposed algorithm was compared with fine-tuning and other existing methods. Moreover, the biological function of selected genetic features was further interpreted, and the response to a panel of approved drugs was predicted for different risk levels. Results The proposed algorithm showed good sensitivity (74–100%) in the validation sets, compared with two simple models whose sensitivity only reached 47% and 60%. The prognostic gene signature used in this study was highly connected to AKT, a key component of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which influences the tumorigenesis, proliferation, and progression of OC. Conclusion These findings demonstrated an improvement in the sensitivity of risk classification of OC patients with our risk prediction models compared with other methods. Ongoing effort is needed to validate the outcomes of this approach for precise clinical treatment.","2021-05-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","113-122","","","30","","Journal of Advanced Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Machine learning; Gene expression; Ovarian cancer; Bagging algorithm; GA-XGBoost; Risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the era of precision medicine, current technologies for DNA methylation identification require not only professional and time-consuming operation but also sophisticated apparatus and complex data interpretation, which has highlighted the need to develop a straightforward and competent strategy for DNA methylation detection. Therefore, the present research is dedicated to establish a novel biosensor by integrating of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and lateral flow device (LFD) to identify trace of DNA methylation from highly heterogeneous cancerous specimen. In order to resolve the natural contradiction between sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid amplification-based detection methods, we introduce the biotin labeled inner primer and digoxigenin labeled dUTP into LAMP-LFD for the first time, which allow this biosensor to identify as low as 150 copies or 0.1 % target variants under strong interferential background within 35 min after bisulfite conversion. Furthermore, the gold magnetic nanoparticle serving as a signal generator in LFD enables the result to be interpreted through both visual and magnetic detection. The promoter methylation pattern of miR-34a, a significant tumor suppressor gene, has been investigated using LAMP-LFD with cell lines and clinical samples, which indicate that this biosensor may be readily adapted for detection of other DNA methylation biomarkers as a sensitive screening tool for cancer diagnosis.","2021-04-15","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","129624","","","333","","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Loop-mediated isothermal amplification; DNA methylation; Lateral flow device; miR-34a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It allows indicating the cyclic modulations in the signal via analysis of a bi-frequency map called Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSC). A non-zero CSC value at two frequencies means the presence of the cyclic process. Unfortunately, we have found that for some cyclostationary signals CSC provides difficult to interpret information. These disturbances in the CSC map have been linked to the presence of non-Gaussian noise. To prove it an original procedure has been proposed. Using simulations covering the model of signal, α-stable distribution, and Monte Carlo simulations it has been shown that indeed increasing presence of non-Gaussian noise makes worse the quality of diagnostic information extracted from CSC map. It has been recalled that the Cyclic Spectral Coherence is based on the autocovariance function of a given signal, thus it is properly defined for data coming from the distribution with the finite second moment. Finally, the authors selected three real examples that confirm the simulation-based findings. The main conclusion is before using the CSC analysis for cyclostationary signal one should validate the type of the noise. If noise is Gaussian — the CSC will bring optimal results. For the increasing level of impulsive non-cyclic noise, the CSC map becomes more and more disturbed and the detection of periodic excitation is difficult. Performed simulations on a very generic model some guidelines have been formulated regarding the acceptable level of non-Gaussian noise.","2021-02-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","108814","","","171","","Measurement","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cyclic Spectral Coherence; Cyclostationary analysis; α-stable distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success of these advanced methods depends on the assumption that enough labeled samples for each fault type are available. However, in some practical situations, it is extremely difficult to collect enough data, e.g., when the sudden catastrophic failure happens, only a few samples can be acquired before the system shuts down. This phenomenon leads to the few-shot fault diagnosis aiming at distinguishing the failure attribution accurately under very limited data conditions. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called Feature Space Metric-based Meta-learning Model (FSM3), to overcome the challenge of the few-shot fault diagnosis under multiple limited data conditions. Our method is a mixture of general supervised learning and episodic metric meta-learning, which will exploit both the attribute information from individual samples and the similarity information from sample groups. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms a series of baseline methods on the 1-shot and 5-shot learning tasks of bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis across various limited data conditions.

Clinical diagnosis can be based on the selected 2D key-frames from five views. Limited by the availability of multi-view data, most methods have to rely on the insufficient single view analysis. This study proposes to automatically analyze the multi-view echocardiograms with a practical end-to-end framework. We collect the five-view echocardiograms video records of 1308 subjects (including normal controls, ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients and atrial septal defect (ASD) patients) with both disease labels and standard-view key-frame labels. Depthwise separable convolution-based multi-channel networks are adopted to largely reduce the network parameters. We also approach the imbalanced class problem by augmenting the positive training samples. Our 2D key-frame model can diagnose CHD or negative samples with an accuracy of 95.4%, and in negative, VSD or ASD classification with an accuracy of 92.3%. To further alleviate the work of key-frame selection in real-world implementation, we propose an adaptive soft attention scheme to directly explore the raw video data. Four kinds of neural aggregation methods are systematically investigated to fuse the information of an arbitrary number of frames in a video. Moreover, with a view detection module, the system can work without the view records. Our video-based model can diagnose with an accuracy of 93.9% (binary classification), and 92.1% (3-class classification) in a collected 2D video testing set, which does not need key-frame selection and view annotation in testing. The detailed ablation study and the interpretability analysis are provided. The presented model has high diagnostic rates for VSD and ASD that can be potentially applied to the clinical practice in the future. The short-term automated machine learning process can partially replace and promote the long-term professional training of primary doctors, improving the primary diagnosis rate of CHD in China, and laying the foundation for early diagnosis and timely treatment of children with CHD.","2021-04-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","101942","","","69","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Congenital heart disease; Multi-channel networks; Multi-view learning; Neural aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as ‘weight low’ or ‘glucose level high’ while describing symptoms. This paper proposes an approach by performing data-driven learning of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule bases for clinical decision support. The approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, capable of capturing simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the framework of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), thereby further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents. Experimental studies on popular medical data benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed work is able to learn compact rule bases involving simple rule antecedents, with statistically better or comparable performance to those achieved by state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","101986","","","111","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clinical decision support; Fuzzy rule-based systems; Medical diagnostic systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present work addresses the classification of neurotypical and ASD subjects by combining knowledge about both the structure and the functional activity of the brain. In particular, we model the brain structure as a graph, and the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) signals as values that live on the nodes of that graph. We then borrow tools from the emerging field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to build features related to the frequency content of these signals. In order to make these features highly discriminative, we apply an extension of the Fukunaga-Koontz transform. Finally, we use these new markers to train a decision tree, an interpretable classification scheme, which results in a final diagnosis aid model. Interestingly, the resulting decision tree outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) collection. Moreover, the analysis of the predictive markers reveals the influence of the frontal and temporal lobes in the diagnosis of the disorder, which is in line with previous findings in the literature of neuroscience.

This paper presents a supervised multi-label classification framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the presence of 14 common thoracic diseases and observations. We tackle this problem by training state-of-the-art CNNs that exploit hierarchical dependencies among abnormality labels.

Improvement in outcomes has remained largely unchanged in nearly 20 years. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is often used in diagnosis and management. Machine learning analyses of large-scale MRI data are pivotal in advancing the diagnosis, management and improve outcomes in neuro-oncology. A common challenge to robust machine learning approaches is the lack of large ‘ground truth’ datasets in supervised learning for building classification and prediction models. The creation of these datasets relies on human-expert input and is time-consuming and subjective error-prone, limiting effective machine learning applications. Simulation of mechanistic aspects such as geometry, location and physical properties of brain tumours can generate large-scale ground-truth datasets allowing for comparison of analysis techniques in clinical applications. We aimed to develop a transparent and convenient method for building ‘ground truth’ presentations of simulated glioma lesions on anatomical MRI. Materials/methods The simulation workflow was created using the Feature Manipulation Engine (FME®), a data integration platform specializing in the spatial data processing. By compiling and integrating FME’s functions to read, integrate, transform, validate, save, and display MRI data, and experimenting with ways to manipulate the parameters concerning location, size, shape, and signal intensity with the presentations of glioma, we were able to generate simulated appearances of high-grade gliomas on gadolinium-based high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI (1 mm3). Data of patients with canonical high-grade tumours were used as real-world tumours for validating the accuracy of the simulation. Twenty raters who are experienced with brain tumour interpretation on MRI independently completed a survey, designed to distinguish simulated and real-world brain tumours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for assessing the performance of the approach with the binary classification of simulated vs real-world tumours. Correlation and regression were used in run time analysis, assessing the software toolset’s efficiency in producing different numbers of simulated lesions. Differences in the group means were examined using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Results The simulation method was developed as an interpretable and useful workflow for the easy creation of tumour simulations and incorporation into 3D MRI. A linear increase in the running time and memory usage was observed with an increasing number of generated lesions. The respondents' accuracy rate ranged between 33.3 and 83.3 %. The sensitivity and specificity were low for a human expert to differentiate simulated lesions from real gliomas (0.43 and 0.58) or vice versa (0.65 and 0.62). The mean scores ranking the real-world gliomas did not differ between the simulated and real tumours. Conclusion The reliable and user-friendly software method can allow for robust simulation of high-grade glioma on MRI.

This study evaluates a novel method of using thermal responses to nonintrusively measure leakage rates in compressed air lines.

To help make decisions by using the accumulated data, this paper proposes a data-driven decision model based on dynamical classifier selection (DCS). Under the framework of multi-criteria decision making, historical data including individual assessments on criteria and overall assessments are collected and represented by interval-valued numbers. A set of base classifiers is selected and trained using historical data. For each new alternative, its similar historical alternatives are identified from historical data through using its prediction derived from each trained classifier. By using the predictive accuracy of each base classifier and the average similarity between the new alternative and its similar historical alternatives, a new DCS strategy is developed to select an appropriate classifier from base classifiers for the new alternative. The developed DCS strategy effectively avoids the subjective determination of the size of the local region in the field of DCS. Based on the similar historical alternatives determined by the selected base classifier, an optimization model is constructed to learn criterion weights from the individual assessments of the alternatives on criteria and the predicted overall assessments derived from the selected base classifier. Then, the explainable decisions are generated with the learned criterion weights. The proposed decision model is used to aid the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Through its comparison with traditional decision model and three representative DCS methods, the advantage of the proposed decision model in balancing accuracy and interpretability is validated.","2021-01-05","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:31","106590","","","212","","Knowledge-Based Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Data-driven decision model; Diagnoses of thyroid nodules; Dynamical classifier selection; Explainable decision-making; Interval-valued numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As opposed to that, the difference in performance between deep classifiers is within 2%. We found an insignificant difference in performance between deep classifiers trained from scratch and corresponding classifiers pre-trained on non-domain image datasets. The best micro balanced accuracy estimated on the independent test set by the U-Net++ classifier equals 89.34%.

A major feature of this work is characterising the tissue by classifying it into 12 meaningful dermatological classes, including hair follicles, sweat glands as well as identifying the well-defined stratified layers of the skin. These provide highly interpretable outputs as the network is trained to represent the problem domain in the same way a pathologist would.

Recent multi-task learning methods require expensive annotations for skin lesion analysis while single-task driven models cannot fully utilize the potential knowledge. The aim of this study is to utilize the neglected knowledge by a flexible architecture in dermoscopy skin lesion classification and segmentation. In this work, we propose a cascade knowledge diffusion network (CKDNet) to transfer and aggregate knowledge learnt from different tasks to simultaneously boost the performances of classification and segmentation. CKDNet consists of a sequence of coarse-level segmentation, classification, and fine-level segmentation networks. We design two novel feature entanglement modules, Entangle-Cls and Entangle-Seg, for classification and segmentation. The Entangle-Cls module aggregates the diffused features from initial segmentation to drive the classification network’s attention to image regions relevant to the disease. The Entangle-Seg module integrates the cascaded context knowledge learnt from classification to benefit fine-level segmentation, especially at uncertain boundaries. The entanglement modules can adaptively control the knowledge that can be diffused from one task to another, which avoids the empirical selection of weights for different learning tasks compared to other multi-task methods. We perform extensive evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on skin lesion classification and segmentation with challenge datasets, ISIC2017 and ISIC2018. Our CKDNet demonstrated superior performance without using any ensemble approaches or any external datasets.

The prevalent practice of manual coding, carried out by trained medical coders, is error-prone and time-consuming. Mitigating this labor-intensive process by developing diagnostic coding systems built on patients’ Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is vital. However, developing nations with low digitization rates have limited availability of structured EMRs, thereby necessitating a need for systems that leverage unstructured data sources. Despite the rich clinical information available in such unstructured data, modeling them is complex, owing to the variety and sparseness of diagnostic codes, complex structural and temporal nature of summaries, and prolific use of medical jargon. This work proposes a context-attentive network to facilitate automatic diagnostic code assignment as a multi-label classification problem. The proposed model facilitates information aggregation across a patient’s discharge summary via multi-channel, variable-sized convolutional filters to extract multi-granular snippets. The attention mechanism enables selecting vital segments in those snippets that map to the clinical codes.

As a consequence, early diagnosis would provide more effective and prompt care strategies, that cloud successfully influence patients’ life expectancy. However, the most performing systems implement the so called black-box approach, which do not provide explicit rules to reach a decision. This lack of interpretability, has hampered the acceptance of those systems by clinicians and their deployment on the field. In this context, we perform a thorough comparison of different machine learning (ML) techniques, whose classification results are characterized by different levels of interpretability. Such techniques were applied for automatically identify PD patients through the analysis of handwriting and drawing samples. Results analysis shows that white-box approaches, such as Cartesian Genetic Programming and Decision Tree, allow to reach a twofold goal: support the diagnosis of PD and obtain explicit classification models, on which only a subset of features (related to specific tasks) were identified and exploited for classification. Obtained classification models provide important insights for the design of non-invasive, inexpensive and easy to administer diagnostic protocols. Comparison of different ML approaches (in terms of both accuracy and interpretability) has been performed on the features extracted from the handwriting and drawing samples included in the publicly available PaHaW and NewHandPD datasets.

This paper presents a forest-based variable selection algorithm that analyzes the distribution of a variable in the decision tree structure, called Variable Depth Distribution, to measure its importance. The proposed variable selection algorithm is developed for datasets with correlated variables that pose problems for existing forest-based variable selection methods. The proposed variable selection method is evaluated and analyzed using three case studies: survival analysis of lead–acid batteries in heavy-duty vehicles, engine misfire detection, and a simulated prognostics dataset. The results show the usefulness of the proposed algorithm, with respect to existing forest-based methods, and its ability to identify important variables in different applications.

Although several studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT and X-ray, the generalization on unseen samples needs to be improved. To tackle this problem, we present the contrastive multi-task convolutional neural network (CMT-CNN), which is composed of two tasks. The main task is to diagnose COVID-19 from other pneumonia and normal control. The auxiliary task is to encourage local aggregation though a contrastive loss: first, each image is transformed by a series of augmentations (Poisson noise, rotation, etc.). Then, the model is optimized to embed representations of a same image similar while different images dissimilar in a latent space. In this way, CMT-CNN is capable of making transformation-invariant predictions and the spread-out properties of data are preserved. We demonstrate that the apparently simple auxiliary task provides powerful supervisions to enhance generalization. We conduct experiments on a CT dataset (4,758 samples) and an X-ray dataset (5,821 samples) assembled by open datasets and data collected in our hospital. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive learning (as plugin module) brings solid accuracy improvement for deep learning models on both CT (5.49%-6.45%) and X-ray (0.96%-2.42%) without requiring additional annotations.

Their early detection and ensuing treatment are essential to prevent visual damage, as the number of people affected by diabetes is expected to grow exponentially. Retinal diseases progress slowly, without any discernible symptoms. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a diagnostic tool capable of analyzing and identifying the quantitative discrimination in the disease affected retinal layers with high resolution. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based classifier for the computer-aided classification of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), drusen, Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) from normal OCT images of the retina. Methods In the proposed method, we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying and detecting severe retinal pathologies from OCT images using a deep convolutional neural network having six convolutional blocks. The classification results are explained using a gradient-based class activation mapping algorithm. Results Training and validation of the model are performed on a public dataset of 83,484 images with expert-level disease grading of CNV, DME, and drusen, in addition to normal retinal image. We achieved a precision of 99.69%, recall of 99.69%, and accuracy of 99.69% with only three misclassifications out of 968 test cases. Conclusion In the proposed work, downsampling and weight sharing were introduced to improve the training efficiency and were found to reduce the trainable parameters significantly. The class activation mapping was also performed, and the output image was similar to the retina’s actual color OCT images. The proposed network used only 6.9% of learnable parameters compared to the existing ResNet-50 model and yet outperformed it in classification. The proposed work can be potentially employed in real-time applications due to reduced complexity and fewer learnable parameters over other models.","2021-03-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:32","105877","","","200","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","OctNET","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Optical coherence tomography; Class activation mapping; Computer-aided detection and diagnosis; Eye","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mining data from physiological time series is crucial for promoting healthy living and reducing governmental medical expenditure. Recently, research and applications of deep learning methods on physiological time series have developed rapidly because such data can be continuously recorded by smart wristbands or smartwatches. However, existing deep learning methods suffer from excessive model complexity and a lack of explanation. This paper aims to handle these issues. Methods: We propose TEG-net, which is a novel deep learning method for accurately diagnosing and explaining physiological time series. TEG-net constructs T-net (a multi-scale bi-directional temporal convolutional neural network) to model physiological time series directly, E-net (personalized linear model) to model expert features extracted from physiological time series, and G-net (gating neural network) to combine T-net and E-net for diagnosis. The combination of T-net and E-net through G-net improves diagnosis accuracy and E-net can be utilized for explanation. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that TEG-net outperforms the second-best baseline by 13.68% in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and 11.49% in terms of area under the precision-recall curve. Additionally, intuitive justifications can be provided to explain model predictions.

This paper attempts to quantify the face perceptual ability of human subjects using their memory responses, acquired by an electroencephalographic (EEG) device, during engagement of the human subjects in a face recognition task. The entire experimental protocol is designed in the settings of pattern recognition, comprising five main steps, namely artifact removal, feature extraction, classifier training and testing, and face-perception ability measurement. The primary objective of the paper is to design a deep neural network model that utilizes both the temporal and spatial EEG features to categorize the familiar face (FF) and unfamiliar face (UF) responses of human subjects from their brain signals. To extract the spatial information, the acquired raw EEG data is transformed into multi-spectral 2-dimensional images by a deep learning approach. The spatial information, along with the EEG time-frequency domain (temporal) features are then utilized to train the proposed deep neural network, which can preserve the spatial as well as temporal EEG features that are more robust and less sensitive to the variations along each dimension. The proposed deep neural network paradigm demonstrates promising results in classifying the EEG responses for FF and UF recognition with high classification accuracy. Biological underpinning of the cortical mechanism using sLORETA and event related potential (ERP) analysis in perceiving FFs and UFs by both the healthy controls and prosopagnosic patients is also a significant inclusion in the paper. The first and foremost advantage of the proposed work is that it provides a technological means to assess the variations in face perceptual ability of individuals. It can also be used as a biomarker for early prosopagnosia diagnosis.","2021-04-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:32","102368","","","66","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Face perception-ability; Prosopagnosia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data provide a promising way to understand energy usage patterns and improve building energy management. However, previous studies have paid more attention to methodologies for the identification of energy usage patterns and are limited in the interpretability and applications of the patterns. In this context, this paper proposes a general data mining-based framework that can extract typical electricity load patterns (TELPs) and discover insightful information hidden in the patterns. The framework integrates multiple data mining techniques and mainly consists of three phases: data preparation, identification of TELPs and knowledge discovery in the patterns. A new clustering method with a two-step clustering analysis is proposed to identify the TELPs at the individual building level. Before clustering, five statistical features that represent the shapes of electricity load profiles are first defined to reduce the dimensions of daily electricity load profiles. The first clustering step aims at detecting outliers of daily electricity load profiles (DELPs) by using the density-based spatial clustering application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm clustering technique, which addresses the data quality issues for electricity consumption data derived from energy consumption monitoring platforms (ECMPs). The second clustering step aims at grouping similar DELPs by means of the k-means algorithm to extract TELPs. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering method is demonstrated by a comparison with two single-step clustering techniques. Furthermore, a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is employed to discover insightful knowledge on TELPs and improve the interpretability of clustering results, namely, to explain the relations between dynamic influencing factors related to electricity consumption and TELPs. The proposed framework is applied to analyze the time-series electricity consumption data of three practical office buildings in Chongqing, and its effectiveness has been confirmed. A potential application of discovered knowledge is presented: early fault detection of anomalous electricity load profiles. The proposed framework can provide building managers with an efficient way to understand the characteristics of building electricity usage patterns and detect anomalies therein.","2021-01-15","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:32","110601","","","231","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Building energy management; Decision tree; Electricity usage pattern; Time series clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the limitation of common rapid assays (e.g. lateral flow immunochromatographic and enzyme immunoassays) in terms of multiplexing, sensitivity, simplicity, and ease-of-use, the mPAD is constructed with a three dimensional (3D) configuration of paper components with a multi-channel design. Multiple fluidic paths developed with wax-patterned paper allow the simultaneous detection of glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A, and toxin B without any cross-reactivity. The 3D fluidic network on the mPAD facilitates a self-operating test procedure for the mixing and addition of amplification reagents with a one-step sliding operation. The results of the multiplex CDI assay can be easily interpreted by the naked eye within 10 min, and are visually intensified over time resulting in up to 3-fold signal amplification. Our device exhibited remarkable analytical performances for the simultaneous detection of three CDI biomarkers, providing a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 88%, accuracy of 95%, and limits of detection for glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A, and toxin B of 0.16 ng mL−1, 0.09 ng mL−1, and 0.03 ng mL−1, respectively. These results indicate the high applicability and feasibility of mPAD for multiplex testing for CDI with the advantages of being simple, sensitive, inexpensive, user-friendly, and equipment-free.","2021-03-15","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:32","112894","","","176","","Biosensors and Bioelectronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; infection; Multiplex assay; Paper-based devices; Point-of-care testing; Signal amplification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also well known that for underdetermined multistage assembly processes (MAPs), the number of measurements is less than that of process errors so that the traditional methods are not available for the variation source identification. Therefore, there exists a substantial challenge for fault diagnosis of underdetermined MAPs, especially for the case with multiple fault patterns. To tackle this problem, a novel approach that integrates statistical analysis with domain knowledge is proposed in this paper. First, the variation propagation model is employed to reveal the inherent relationship between key control characteristics and key product characteristics, and then the corresponding variance model is constructed to interpret process faults by means of the abnormal variance of process errors. Considering that the probability of less process faults is far higher than that of more process faults in MAPs, the problem of fault diagnosis is further transformed into searching the sparse solution of abnormal variance changes for process faults. Afterwards, based on the non-negative property of the covariance matrix, an enhanced Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to favor sparse estimation of the variance for the underdetermined system in MAPs. Finally, experimental results of both the numeric simulation and practical case study demonstrate the proposed diagnosis methodology can effectively identify the process faults for different patterns with system noise.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:41","2021-06-05 17:27:32","280-290","","","58","","Journal of Manufacturing Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault diagnosis; Bayesian hierarchical model; Multistage assembly process; Sparse solution; Underdetermined system; Variation propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
