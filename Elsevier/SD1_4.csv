This paper proposes a novel automatic epileptic EEG detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with two innovative improvements and treats this task as a big data classification issue. Due to that CNN could extract and learn features automatically, the multi-channels time-series EEG recordings extracted by a sliding window are fed into the CNN model. Firstly, a 12-layers CNN is designed as the baseline epileptic EEG classification model. Afterward, the merger of the increasing and decreasing sequences (MIDS) is introduced to highlight the characteristic of waveforms. Then, a data augmentation method, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGANs), increases the sample diversity as well as EEG information. In this experiment, the recordings are from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, and the patient-cross performance with the train set from other patients and test set from the withheld patient is evaluated. The epileptic EEG classification results show that the original CNN achieves 70.68% sensitivity and 92.30% specificity, while CNN with MIDS and data augmentation yield 74.08% sensitivity, 92.46% specificity and 72.11% sensitivity, 95.89% specificity respectively. These two novel improvements both increased automatic epileptic EEG classification performance. Furthermore, in seizure onset detection, 90.57% seizure events are detected with the mean latency 4.68s using probability smoothing. The proposed method could lighten the EEG interpretation workload of clinicians effectively, and has great significance in auxiliary diagnosis of epilepsy.","2019-08-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","101551","","","53","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\4SM4QJ92\S1746809419301259.html","","","Convolutional neural network; Electroencephalography; Merger of the increasing and decreasing sequences; Time-series; Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MCI diagnosis is instrumental in preventing Alzheimer’s; however, its manifestations are complicated (i.e. distinguishing the symptoms is not easy) and MCI is often confused with the normal consequences of aging. To have an accurate and reliable Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based screening tool for MCI diagnosis, we are developing a new supervised dictionary-learning-based analysis of EEG signals, namely Correlation-based Label Consistent K-SVD (CLC-KSVD), which would solve the non-repeatability problem of conventional K-SVD. The proposed method is applied on both time and frequency domains, i.e. 1) the extracted patches from EEG signals recorded at resting state with eyes closed, and 2) the extracted spectral features from these EEG signals. The final label for each EEG signal (in different channels and zones) is obtained by voting between the labels of the whole of time and spectral patches. The evaluation results for the EEG signals of 61 subjects illustrate that CLC-KSVD outperforms other methods (the best accuracy of 88.9% was obtained in F7, T3 channels and the left temporal zone). Furthermore, the results are investigated using the volumetric analysis of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, indicating that the most significant difference between healthy and MCI groups were in the superior temporal and pars triangularis in the left hemisphere. Such location matching between EEG and MR images demonstrates that the results of CLC-KSVD are anatomically interpretable.","2019-08-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","101559","","","53","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2TM3XJ8U\S1746809419301338.html","","","Dictionary learning; Alzheimer’s disease; EEG; Mild cognitive impairment; Sparse coding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent the occurrence of advanced GCs, there is a need for immediate detection and treatment of gastric precancerous and early cancerous lesions. Magnification endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) system as an advanced diagnostic imaging technology is widely used in evaluating gastric lesion types, which can interpret gastric lesion characteristics by enhancing contrasts between vessels and mucosal surfaces. Based on microvascular morphologies presented on M-NBI images, physicians can manually diagnose gastric lesions; but this is a tough work for unexperienced doctors and it is lacking of objectivity. In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework by fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify gastric M-NBI images into three classes: chronic gastritis (CGT), low grade neoplasia (LGN) and early gastric cancer (EGC). The method we choose is used to compare with three kinds of traditional handcraft texture feature extraction methods and CNN models trained directly by our dataset. Results show that the performance of fine-tuned CNNs outperforms traditional handcraft features and trained CNNs. Experiments also illustrate that ResNet50 can achieve 0.96 accuracy, 0.92, 0.91 and 0.99 f1-scores for classifying M-NBI images into CGT, LGN and EGC.

This paper proposes a systematic methodology for deriving such features based on diverse observation perspectives in time (direct and aggregated) and defined specific data objects. We introduce a novel data model which combines collected samples into higher level observation objects (pulses and their compositions). This model is supported with original analysis algorithms for evaluating system behaviour. These provide useful sample/object statistics significantly enhanced with derived correlation formulas and periodicity properties. Compared with classical approaches, our model assures deeper and more accurate insight into system operation under real workload conditions as it uses new evaluation metrics and a wider scope of observation features (e.g. those related to pulse objects).

Since interpreting MRI data can be complex and ambiguous, there is a need for robust computational methods able to quantify placental anatomy (including its vasculature) and function. In this work, we propose a novel fully-automated method to segment the placenta and its peripheral blood vessels from fetal MRI. First, a super-resolution reconstruction of the uterus is generated by combining axial, sagittal and coronal views. The placenta is then segmented using 3D Gabor filters, texture features and Support Vector Machines. A uterus edge-based instance selection is proposed to identify the support vectors defining the placenta boundary. Subsequently, peripheral blood vessels are extracted through a curvature-based corner detector. Our approach is validated on a rich set of 44 control and pathological cases: singleton and (normal / monochorionic) twin pregnancies between 25–37 weeks of gestation. Dice coefficients of 0.82  ±  0.02 and 0.81  ±  0.08 are achieved for placenta and its vasculature segmentation, respectively. A comparative analysis with state of the art convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely, 3D U-Net, V-Net, DeepMedic, Holistic3D Net, HighRes3D Net and Dense V-Net is also conducted for placenta localization, with our method outperforming all CNN approaches.

The main objective of our study is to expand an automatic expert system (ES) to provide an accurate diagnosis of BC. Both, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were applied to analyze BC data. The well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), available in the UCI repository, was examined in our study. We first tested the SVM algorithm using various values of the C, ɛ and γ parameters. As a result of the first experiment, we were able to observe that the adjustment of these regularization parameters can greatly improve the performance of the traditional SVM algorithm applied for BC detection. The highest obtained accuracy at the first step was 99.71%. Then, we performed a new BC detection approach based on two ensemble learning techniques: the confidence-weighted voting method and the boosting ensemble technique. Our model, called CWV-BANNSVM, combines boosting ANNs (BANN) and two SVMs, using optimal parameters selected during the first experiment. The performance of the applied methods was evaluated using several popular metrics, such as specificity, sensitivity, precision, FPR, FNR, F1 score, AUC, Gini and accuracy. The proposed CWV-BANNSVM model was able to improve the performance of the traditional machine learning algorithms applied to BC detection, reaching the accuracy of 100%. To overcome the overfitting issue, we determined and used some appropriate parameter values of polynomial SVM. Our comparison with the existing studies dedicated to BC prediction suggests that the proposed CWV-BANN-SVM model provides one of the best prediction performances overall.","2019-11-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","557-570","","","146","","Measurement","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\RMRY4F4B\S0263224119304385.html","","","Machine learning; Data mining; Breast cancer; Support vector machine; Artificial neural network; Ensemble technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water and two concentrations of silica-water nanofluid (0.005 and 0.01% (V/V)) have been subjected to isolated nucleate pool boiling on a ITO-coated borofloat heater by supplying constant heat flux. Experimental measurements have been made in a purely non-intrusive manner by employing refractive index-based rainbow schlieren deflectometry technique. Bubble dynamic parameters, such as bubble departure diameter and departure frequency, wait and growth times etc. and the temperature gradients in the bulk fluid have been mapped simultaneously in the form of schlieren images. Results on bubble dynamic parameters revealed that these parameters show more variability and assume skewed normal distribution in the case of nanofluids whereas water experiments showed insignificant variations in these parameters. Of the significant changes, the bubble departure diameter reduced, departure frequency and growth rate increased with increasing concentration of nanofluids. Schlieren images corresponding to 0.005 and 0.01% (V/V) nanofluids showed more spreading out of the superheat layer adjacent to the heater substrate than that observed in the case of water experiments. Time-averaged values of natural convection and evaporative heat transfer rates associated with single bubble-based boiling indicated that both these rates decrease in the presence of dispersed silica nanoparticles. Reduction in the overall heat transfer rate in the case of nanofluids has been explained on the basis of direct experimental measurements. In this direction, the observed phenomenon has been attributed to the role played by the suspended nanoparticles in diffusing the thermal gradients (reflected in the form of the broadening of the superheat layer) adjacent to the heater substrate along with substantially increasing the wait time of bubble inception in the case of nanofluids as compared to water-based experiments conducted under same wall superheat conditions.","2019-04-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","612-625","","","138","","International Journal of Thermal Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\9PYYLSTD\S1290072918312006.html","","","Nanofluids; Bubble dynamics; Heat transfer rates; Nucleate pool boiling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has explored potential ASD subgroups with preliminary evidence supporting the existence of behaviorally and genetically distinct subgroups; however, research has yet to leverage machine learning to identify phenotypes on a scale large enough to robustly examine treatment response across such subgroups. The purpose of the present study was to apply Gaussian Mixture Models and Hierarchical Clustering to identify behavioral phenotypes of ASD and examine treatment response across the learned phenotypes. Materials and methods The present study included a sample of children with ASD (N = 2400), the largest of its kind to date. Unsupervised machine learning was applied to model ASD subgroups as well as their taxonomic relationships. Retrospective treatment data were available for a portion of the sample (n  = 1034). Treatment response was examined within each subgroup via regression. Results The application of a Gaussian Mixture Model revealed 16 subgroups. Further examination of the subgroups through Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering suggested 2 overlying behavioral phenotypes with unique deficit profiles each composed of subgroups that differed in severity of those deficits. Furthermore, differentiated response to treatment was found across subtypes, with a substantially higher amount of variance accounted for due to the homogenization effect of the clustering. Discussion The high amount of variance explained by the regression models indicates that clustering provides a basis for homogenization, and thus an opportunity to tailor treatment based on cluster memberships. These findings have significant implications on prognosis and targeted treatment of ASD, and pave the way for personalized intervention based on unsupervised machine learning.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","29-36","","","129","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\TBIXNJ57\S1386505618308669.html","","","Autism spectrum disorder; Machine learning; Cluster analysis; Behavioral phenotypes; Treatment response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many methodologies have been widely adopted to detect it. However, much existing method did not integrate with diagnostic logic of clinician and practical application. The aim of the paper is to provide an automated interpretable detection method of myocardial infarction. Methods The paper presents a novel method fusing energy entropy and morphological features for MI detection via 12 leads ECG. Specifically, ECG signals are firstly decomposed by maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT), then energy entropy is calculated from the decomposed coefficients as global features. Area, kurtosis coefficient, skewness coefficient and standard deviation extracted from QRS wave and ST-T segment of ECG beat are computed as local morphological features. Combining global features based on record and local features based on beat for single lead, all the 12 leads features are fused as the ultimate feature vector. What's more, different methods including principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and locality preserving projection (LPP) are employed to reduce the computational complexity and redundant information. Meanwhile, principal component features are ranked by F-value. To evaluate the proposed method, PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) database and inter-patient paradigm are employed.

Despite the standardization of the FRA measurement procedure, the interpretation of the results is still a subject of study. The reason lies in the fact that the frequency response is different from case to case. Therefore, for interpreting a transformer FRA result, the effects of various possible mechanical changes on the FRA trace of that particular transformer should be known. Additionally, real mechanical deformations cannot be executed for obtaining the required information due to the destructive nature. Hence, the transformer winding models are utilized instead to study the frequency response. While the circuit model has been extensively discussed in the literature, there is little focus on the numerical methods for the FRA purpose. To take a step forward, this contribution investigates the applicability of the finite integration technique for the FRA studies. The presented model can simulate different fault types for the FRA interpretation while it has also other applications regarding the frequency response. In this contribution, the FRA traces are derived directly from a finite integration model which is an important improvement compared with the previous papers. The agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data indicates that the proposed model has the potential of providing a powerful tool to decipher the transformer frequency behavior.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","411-418","","","110","","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\AQAWNP5Q\S0142061518335361.html","","","Fault diagnosis; Simulation; Finite integration technique; Frequency response; Indices; Power transformers testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system inputs and outputs collected from sensors and smart devices has become a challenging problem and an active area of research in many application domains. In this article, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework that is able to model the relationship between system inputs (sensor measurements) and outputs (response variables) without imposing strong distributional/parametric assumptions while using only a subset of training samples and sensor attributes. Then, an optimal cost-sensitive anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is an anomalous one taking into consideration the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates. The model can be used for both supervised and unsupervised settings depending on the availability of data regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. The unsupervised model is particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies that a system may present and where no data are available regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. A Bayesian hierarchical setting is used to structure the proposed framework and help with accommodating uncertainty, imposing interpretability, and controlling the sparsity and complexity of the proposed anomaly detection framework. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is also developed for model training using past data. The numerical experiments conducted using a simulated data set and a wind turbine data set demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for system response modeling and anomaly detection.","2019-04-15","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","561-582","","","240","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GH6MX7GB\S0306261919303150.html","","","Anomaly detection; Wind turbine; Dynamic systems; Bayesian Modeling; Sensor-intensive energy systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, hospital mortality depends on diverse patient characteristics; thus, complete risk stratification is crucial to correctly estimate a patient’s prognosis. Electronic health records include standard medical data; however, standard nursing data, such as nursing diagnoses (which were considered essential for a complete picture of the patient condition) are seldom included. Objective To explore the independent predictive power of nursing diagnoses on patient hospital mortality and to investigate whether the inclusion of this variable in addition to medical diagnostic data can enhance the performance of risk adjustment tools. Methods Prospective observational study in one Italian university hospital. Data were collected for six months from a clinical nursing information system and the hospital discharge register. The number of nursing diagnoses identified by nurses within 24 h after admission was used to express the nursing dependency index (NDI). Eight logistic regression models were tested to predict patient mortality, by adding to a first basic model considering patient’s age, sex, and modality of hospital admission, the level of comorbidity (CCI), and the nursing and medical condition as expressed by the NDI and the All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group weight (APR-DRGw), respectively. Results Overall, 2301 patients were included. The addition of the NDI to the model increased the explained variance by 20%. The explained variance increased by 56% when the APR-DRGw, CCI, and NDI were included. Thus, the latter model was nearly highly accurate (c = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.87–0.92). Conclusion Nursing diagnoses have an independent power in predicting hospital mortality. The explained variance in the predictive models improved when nursing data were included in addition to medical data. These findings strengthen the need to include standardized nursing data in electronic health records.","2019-05-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","79-85","","","125","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GVLBJCZR\S1386505618312619.html","","","Predictive models; Diagnosis-related groups; Hospital mortality; Nursing dependency index; Nursing diagnosis; Risk adjustment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, an alternative method is an important tool if avian or reptilian embryo research in this area is to advance. Here, we addressed, a non-invasive method to diagnosis cardiac arrhythmia based on optical sensor together with signal processing. In such a system, the intensity of transmitted light is mostly affected by pulsatile blood volumes and mechanical activity of the heart during blood pumping. In our measurement procedure, the time domain transmissive signal was transformed into the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). We interpreted the cardiac signal of embryo with a naturally occurred bradycardia throughout the incubation. We found a normal heart rate (HR) during first half of incubation, but HR had two frequency components in the mid incubation and finally a much lower frequency heart rate up until hatching. Early detection of potentially abnormal chicks with cardiovascular defects could significantly contribute to the humane treatment of these embryos and increase production efficiencies by identifying high quality embryos.

Their range of application in industrial settings has been limited due to difficulties regarding the interpretation of results and consistent graph generation.

Successfully performing ultrasound imaging, however, requires extensive training and expertise in navigating a hand-held probe to a correct anatomical location as well as subsequently interpreting the acquired image. Computer-generated simulations can offer a safe, flexible, and standardized environment to train such skills. Data-based simulations display interpolated slices from a-priori-acquired real ultrasound volumes, whereas generative simulations aim to reproduce the complex ultrasound interactions with comprehensive, geometric anatomical models, such as using ray-tracing to mimic acoustic propagation. Although sonographers typically focus on relatively smaller structures of interest in ultrasound images, the fidelity of the background anatomy may still play a role in contributing to the realism of a generated US image; e.g. when imaging a relatively smaller fetus within large abdominal background. It was proposed earlier to compose ray-traced images with acquired volumes in a preprocessing step. Despite its simplicity, this prevents any view-dependent artifacts and interactive model changes, such as those induced by animations, which can, for instance, model fetal motion. To fully leverage the flexibility of the model-based generative approach, we propose herein an on-the-fly image fusion, based on the two techniques, by moving the interpolation stage within the ray-tracer, such that the pre-acquired image data can be referred to in the background, while the acoustic interactions with the model can be resolved in the foreground. This allows for animated anatomical models, which we realize during simulation runtime via scene-hierarchy subtree switching between precomputed acceleration structure graphs. We demonstrate our proposed techniques on ultrasound sequences of fetal and heart motion, where only animated models can afford to meet realism requirements entailed by the temporal domain.","2019-08-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:14","44-52","","","82","","Computers & Graphics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\22S87KUV\S0097849319300603.html","","","Acoustic propagation; Medical training; Monte-Carlo; Sonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2017, Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA) is applied to the fault diagnosis of gearbox. Although MOMEDA overcomes Maximum correlation kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD) defects and it can extract continuous impulse signal, but it still has the following problems: 1) It can only extract single periodic pulse. If we want to extract the characteristics of multiple periodic pulse signals, we need to further update the algorithm; 2) In a strong noise environment, MOMEDA can also search for a fixed periodic signal, but most of the information is false component, it is easy to cause misdiagnosis, therefore, the signal needs to be preprocessed; 3) The accuracy of MOMEDA noise reduction is affected by the search interval and filter size, and McDondald did not reasonably explain them, so an adaptive selection method is needed. Considering these problems. Firstly the article preprocesses the composite fault with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and then reconstructs the intrinsic mode function with the same time scale. Further, proposing kurtosis spectral entropy as the objective function, the grid search method is used to search the filter length of MOMEDA, and the reconstructed intrinsic mode function is further denominated by MOMEDA.

However, the effects due to environmental factors, especially temperature variations may produce significant misinterpretations. Consequently, developing solutions to identify the structural anomaly, accounting for temperature influence, from measurements, is crucial and highly anticipated. This paper presents a Temperature-driven Moving Principal Component Analysis method, designated as Td-MPCA, for anomaly detection. The Td-MPCA introduces the idea of blind source separation (BSS) for thermal identification with intent to enhance the performance of Moving Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) for anomaly detection. To achieve this target, temperature-induced strain variations are first investigated and revealed by employing Independent Component Analysis based on maximization non-Gaussianity, also known as Fast ICA. Afterwards, the MPCA is adopted for anomaly detection on the separated temperature-related response. Three case studies are provided in this paper to evaluate the proposed method. The first one is a numerical truss bridge with a simulated 5% stiffness reduction. The results confirm that Td-MPCA is more sensitive than MPCA in detecting anomalies, where the simulated stiffness loss fails to be detected by MPCA. The second case study is on an experimental truss bridge where two damage scenarios are introduced and interpreted. The detection results show that Td-MPCA outperforms MPCA since the damage is identified at the expected time by Td-MPCA but not by MPCA. The third case study is an in-situ curved viaduct in Switzerland. Data acquired during both construction period and normal service period has been used for interpretation. Results demonstrate that Td-MPCA is able to identify the date of change in construction process without any delay when compared with the application of MPCA only.","2019-07-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:15","447-458","","","190","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Structural health monitoring; Blind source separation; Moving principal component analysis; Temperature effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a few autonomous methods have been proposed to alleviate the demand on the user’s expertise, yet they have been mainly focused on fault detection. This paper follows a similar direction but with wider objectives: it aims to develop an indicator that is able to detect, identify and classify typical faults on rolling elements, inner and outer-race. The indicator is based on the recently developed Fast Order-Frequency Spectral Coherence, a key tool of the theory of second-order cyclostationary processes: it condenses the whole information initially displayed in three dimensions into a scalar and provides an interpretation in terms of a probability of presence of a fault. In addition, the proposed indicator is able to return information for different levels of damages in both stationary and non-stationary operating conditions. It takes into consideration uncertainties in the bearing characteristic frequencies, which is crucial in bearing diagnosis. A new pre-processing step is provided to ensure an efficient and constant statistical threshold. The proposed indicator is intended to be used in an autonomous process without the need for visual analysis and human interpretation. The proposed indicator is compared with a recent indicator based on the Envelop Spectrum, in terms of classification and detection performance.

In this paper, we propose a model called EAD-OF (Elastic Abnormality Detection for Out-flow) to real-time detect the abnormal passenger out-flows and alarm the administrators in time. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of passenger in-flow, out-flow and their correlation. We evaluate our model with real transportation data of the biggest city in China and use large-scale social event data to further explain our model. The result shows that EAD-OF can effectively detect the abnormal out-flows which would cause burst in-flows with performance tens of times better than the baseline models. In term of efficiency, EAD-OF can also beat the direct computation approach several times.","2019-09-24","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","327-340","","","359","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Big data mining; Intelligent transportation system; Online algorithm; Urban computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple causality analysis techniques have been shown to be effective for fault diagnosis [1]. Comparisons of some of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques have been presented in literature [2], [3]. However, there are no clear guidelines on which technique to select for a specific application. These comparative studies have not thoroughly addressed all the factors affecting the selection of techniques. In this paper, these two techniques are compared based on their accuracy, precision, automatability, interpretability, computational complexity, and applicability for different process characteristics. Transfer entropy and Granger causality are popular causality analysis techniques, and therefore these two are selected for this study. The two techniques were tested on an industrial case study of a plant wide oscillation and their features were compared. To investigate the accuracy and precision of Granger causality and transfer entropy, their ability to find true connections in a simulated process was also tested. Transfer entropy was found to be more precise and the causality maps derived from it were more visually interpretable. However, Granger causality was found to be easier to automate, much less computationally expensive, and easier to interpret the meaning of the values obtained. A decision flow was developed from these comparisons to aid users in deciding when to use Granger causality or transfer entropy, as well as to aid in the interpretation of the causality maps obtained from these techniques.","2019-07-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","72-84","","","79","","Journal of Process Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault diagnosis; Causality analysis; Granger causality; Root cause diagnosis; Plant wide oscillation; Transfer entropy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current signature-based systems are heavily reliant on fixed patterns that struggle with unknown or evasive applications, while behavior-based solutions usually leave most of the interpretative work to a human analyst. In this article we propose AIDIS, an Advanced Intrusion Detection and Interpretation System capable to explain anomalous behavior within a network-enabled user session by considering kernel event anomalies identified through their deviation from a set of baseline process graphs. For this purpose we adapt star structures, a bipartite representation used to approximate the edit distance between two graphs. Baseline templates are generated automatically and adapt to the nature of the respective operating system process. We prototypically implemented smart anomaly classification through a set of competency questions applied to graph template deviations and evaluated the approach using both Random Forest and linear kernel support vector machines. The determined attack classes are ultimately mapped to a dedicated APT attacker/defender meta model that considers actions, actors, as well as assets and mitigating controls, thereby enabling decision support and contextual interpretation of ongoing attacks.","2019-07-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","120-147","","","84","","Computers & Security","AIDIS","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Machine learning; Classification; Anomaly detection; Malware; Graph matching; Intrusion detection; Security model; Semantic gap; Star structure; SVM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the processing methods of non-stationary signals. In this paper, an adaptive Kurtogram (AK) method is proposed. The greatest advantage of this method is the use of the order statistics filter (OSF) to estimate and divide the effective modal components from the spectrum to replace the fast Kurtogram (FK). The minimum envelope value of the signal in frequency domain is obtained and taken as the boundaries. Change the sliding window width to divide different boundaries and form an array. The empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is used to reconstruct the signal components according to the boundary array. Then their kurtosis values are calculated. The frequency band with the largest kurtosis value contains the impact information, and the corresponding time domain component presents periodicity impact. AK improves the shortcomings of the center frequency and the bandwidth of the fast Kurtogram (FK) that cannot be explained theoretically. The method of dividing the boundaries in the frequency domain is optimized. After verification by the simulated signals and the actual signals, this method is faster and more efficient.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","87-107","","","130","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Rolling bearing; Adaptive kurtogram; Empirical wavelet transform; Non-stationary signals; Order statistics filter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microwave discharge plasma was maintained in reactor in continuous mode both in hydrogen and in a mixture of hydrogen-methane with a small addition of argon for diagnostic purposes. Intensity distribution of argon emission was characterized by a pronounced maximum near the substrate in reactor, which indicates that microwave power density (MWPD) absorbed in the plasma is also concentrated mainly near the substrate. Maximum emission intensity of hydrogen atoms is located at some distance from the substrate, and maxima of spatial distributions of emission intensity of carbon-containing species C2 and CH are shifted farther away from the substrate. This leads to the fact that the shape and size of discharge, which are observed visually or with help of a camera, significantly differ from the distribution of MWPD. There is a difference in the shape of spatial distribution of argon lines emission (750.4 nm and 811.5 nm), that can be explained by a change in the mechanism for quenching the excited levels of argon in different regions of discharge.

Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated improved accuracy and robustness in classifying machine fault types and severities, when compared with conventional machine learning techniques. A major constraint of DNNs is that they operate as ‘black boxes’, which do not provide insight into how fault classification decisions are made. This not only raises questions on the trustworthiness of the decisions themselves, but also limits further improvement of DNNs for adaptation to a broader range of applications. This paper presents an explainable Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which has been developed on the basis of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), for fault diagnosis of gearboxes. Vibration signals as time series data are first converted to time-frequency spectra images through wavelet transform, which are then classified by a DCNN. To explain the rationale for classification decision, LRP decomposes contributions from local regions in the spectra images to the classification results, and determines which time-frequency points in the spectra image contribute the most to fault type and severity identification. Results of the analysis are then cross-checked with the time-frequency analysis. The effectiveness of the developed explainable DCNN is evaluated by experiments on a gearbox testbed, where gears with different types and degrees of faults are evaluated. LRP results have revealed that a trained DCNN is selective to different frequency bands in the time-frequency spectra for classification of gearbox fault type and severity.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","476-481","","","80","","Procedia CIRP","","26th CIRP Conference on Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA May 7-9, 2019","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault Diagnosis; Explainable Neural Networks; Layer-wise Relevance Propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Personalized conciliation of multiple guidelines considering additionally patient preferences brings some further difficulties. Recently, several works have explored distinct techniques to come up with an automated process for the conciliation of clinical guidelines for comorbid patients but very little attention has been put in integrating the patient preferences into this process. In this work, a Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) framework that extends previous work on single-disease temporal Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) is proposed for the automated conciliation of clinical guidelines with patient-centered preferences. Each agent encapsulates a single-disease Computer Interpretable Guideline (CIG) formalized as an HTN domain and conciliates the decision procedures that encode the clinical recommendations of its CIG with the decision procedures of the other agents’ CIGs. During conciliation, drug-related interactions, scheduling constraints as well as redundant actions and multiple support interactions are solved by an automated planning process. Moreover, the simultaneous application of the patient preferences in multiple diseases may potentially bring about contradictory clinical decisions and more interactions. As a final step, the most adequate personalized treatment plan according to the patient preferences is selected by a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. The MAP approach is tested on a case study that builds upon a simplified representation of two real clinical guidelines for Diabetes Mellitus and Arterial Hypertension.","2019-05-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","167-186","","","96","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clinical guidelines; Comorbidities; Conciliation; HTN planning; Multi-agent planning; Patient preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The collected information could be further used for different purposes, such as performance evaluation, anomaly detection, change detection or fault diagnosis of the operating systems. The analysis of the data streams is done by a calculation tool for estimating the similarity level between pairs of given chunks of data from the data stream, considered as data clouds. One of these data cloud represents a prerecorded (previously known) abnormal operation of the system, while the other data cloud represents a current (still unknown) behavior of the system. Then the similarity analysis will show how close the two data clouds are. In this paper we propose a novel method for similarity analysis that uses two types of models called Data Cloud Model (DCM) and Window Cloud Model (WCM). The DCM is obtained from the data cloud that represents a previously known operation of the system, while the WCM is obtained from the newly collected data cloud from the data stream, called window data cloud. Both data clouds have an equal length (number of data). The algorithms for creating the DCM and WCM are explained in the paper. The DCM consists of Active Grid cells that represent approximately the data density within the known data cloud. The WCM estimates the data density at the same active grid cells, but based on the data from the new window data cloud. Both densities are represented as two Histograms that are compared to each other in order to calculate the similarity level as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Another problem discussed in the paper is finding a plausible method for detection of significant changes in the data streams. Here the moving window technique is used for collecting series of subsequent data clouds. Then two procedures of moving windows are run in parallel, each of them with different window lengths, in order to calculate the center-of-gravity of the respective data in a real time. The difference between the results of the two moving windows is used as an estimate of the change in the process operation.

The filling ratios are classified into three groups based on their distinctive heat transfer and instability behavior. The effects of filling ratio, input heat flux and inclination angle on the temperature nonuniformity, thermal resistance and instability features are examined in detail. The results show that, under the high filling ratios, the heat transfer capacity is seriously limited by the phase-change suppression and the consequent pressure soaring, while is advantageous in avoiding the evaporator dryout. Under the moderate filling ratios, the heat transfer capacity could be significantly higher, but the geyser boiling instability is obvious for a relatively large range of input heat flux, inducing the fluctuation of pressure and temperature. Under the low filling ratios, the heat transfer capacity is the highest; however, the transient local “Near-dryout” is easier to occur, causing large temperature overshoot and oscillation. The different variation trends of thermal resistance and temperature nonuniformity with filling ratios and input heat flux can generally be explained by the variation of the portions of latent and sensible heat transfer. Under the moderate and high filling ratios, the loop thermal resistance decreases somewhat with the decrease of inclination angle due to the elongation of the phase-change surfaces. A thermodynamic state diagram is drawn, indicating the measured average pressure - temperature of the working fluid at the evaporator for the three groups of filling ratios, with distinctly different instability issues, along with the saturation line to aid in the mechanism analysis and trouble diagnosis. A stability map in terms of the phase change number, Npch, and the filling ratio is presented, in which the boundaries dividing the different types of instability and the stable conditions are marked as a guidance for practical design and operation.","2019-03-25","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","262-271","","","151","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Filling ratio; Heat transfer characteristics; Inclination angle; Loop thermosyphon; Two-phase flow instability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, FHR and UC traces are visually analyzed and interpreted by clinicians.

Automatic CTG analysis requires CTG-traces digitalization and thus assessment of a correct sampling frequency (SF). Thus, this paper aims to investigate dependency of automatic CTG analysis on SF in order to identify optimal SF (OSF) for FHR and UC traces that minimizes computational efforts without jeopardizing CTG interpretation. To this aim, the “CTU-CHB intra-partum CTG database” was considered and visually annotated by an expert gynecologist. FHR and UC traces, originally sampled at 4 Hz, were down sampled at 2 Hz, 1 Hz, 0.4 Hz and 0.2 Hz, and automatically analyzed using CTG Analyzer. Eventually, results obtained through automatic analysis were compared to visual annotations, which were taken as reference. A cumulative statistical index (CSI), ranging from 0.00% to 100.00%, was defined as a linear combination of positive-predictive value, sensitivity, false-positive rate and false-negative rate. OSF was defined as the one that maximizes CSI. If CSI was showing the same value for more than one SF, the lowest SF was selected as the optimal since minimizing computational efforts. Results indicate that OSF for FHR is 2 Hz (CSI ≥ 85.41%), whereas OSF for UC is 0.2 Hz (CSI = 75.21%).","2019-05-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","210-215","","","51","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","Digital cardiotocography","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cardiotocography; Computerized cardiotocography; Electronic clinical applications; Fetal monitoring; Signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, EHR-based phenotyping has difficulties in achieving satisfactorily high performance because clinical notes include disease mentions that ultimately signify something other than the patient’s diagnosis (such as differential diagnosis or screening). Our objective is to quantify the influence of such disease mentions on EHR-based phenotyping performance. Methods Physicians manually reviewed whether the disease mentions indicated the patients’ diseases in 487,300 clinical notes of 4,430 patients. Particular focus was placed on disease mentions that did not signify the patient’s diagnosis even though they did not have any syntactic modifier or indicator in the same sentences. Patients were then classified according to whether their clinical notes included such disease mentions. Results Among the patients whose clinical notes included disease mentions without any modifier or indicator, the proportion of patients whose disease mentions signified the patients’ diagnosis was 78.1% (on average). This value can be interpreted as the bias of disease mentions that did not signify the patient’s diagnosis on the precision of EHR-based phenotyping by extracting disease mentions from clinical notes. Conclusion This study quantified the bias occurred owing to disease mentions that incorrectly signify a patient’s diagnosis in the value of precision of EHR-based phenotyping from four dataset types. The results of this study will help researchers in diverse research environments with different available data types.","2019-04-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","90-96","","","124","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vision researchers have been analyzing behaviors of radiologists during screening to understand how and why they miss tumors or misdiagnose. In this regard, eye-trackers have been instrumental in understanding visual search processes of radiologists. However, most relevant studies in this aspect are not compatible with realistic radiology reading rooms. In this study, we aim to develop a paradigm shifting CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies CAD and eye-tracking systems in realistic radiology room settings. We first developed an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Second, we propose a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically, we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data (gaze) into a graph model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve their diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD uses radiologists’ search efficiency by processing their gaze patterns. Furthermore, the C-CAD incorporates a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose suspicious areas simultaneously. The proposed C-CAD system has been tested in a lung cancer screening experiment with multiple radiologists, reading low dose chest CTs. Promising results support the efficiency, accuracy and applicability of the proposed C-CAD system in a real radiology room setting. We have also shown that our framework is generalizable to more complex applications such as prostate cancer screening with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI).","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","101-115","","","51","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Attention; Eye-tracking; Graph sparsification; Lung cancer screening; Multi-task deep learning; Prostate cancer screening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by providing a deep learning driven method for fault classification and degradation assessment. Compared with conventional data-driven methods, deep neural network has the ability to learn multiple nonlinear transformation with high complexity through multiple hidden layers, which helps to capture the main variations and discover the discriminative information from the industrial data. During the experiment, to confirm the effectiveness of deep learning for fault classification and degradation assessment, similar popular data-driven methods, including support vector machine, deep belief network, back propagation neural network, and k-nearest neighbour classification are employed to present a comprehensive comparison in both fault classification and degradation assessment.

Here, unsupervised learning methods that are geared towards high-throughput DNA methylation analysis are used to extract useful information from high-dimensional genome wide methylation data in order to provide crucial insights for accurate early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Herein, these methods are highly dependent on the performance of an earlier step of dimension reduction that aims to find the best subset of attributes to be retained for learning. Widely used algorithms in the literature commonly suffer from resulting in trivial cluster structures and failing to shed light on the relationship between DNA methylation and cancer types due to their myopic and arbitrary search mechanisms. Addressing this issue, we introduce a bimodal unsupervised dimension reduction algorithm (BOUNDER) that identifies the best subset of loci for downstream analysis considering the variability and redundancy across all the samples using bimodal modeling before it feeds into the learning method. BOUNDER models each locus as a bimodal representation using a piecewise linear function with two segments and filters the informative loci based on the fitted line characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, the work presented here is the first study that uses bimodal modeling in unsupervised learning in DNA methylation analysis. BOUNDER is tailored for DNA methylation analysis using a detailed parameter tuning analysis. The performance of BOUNDER is benchmarked against those of widely used conventional algorithms using real lung, breast, kidney, and urological cancer datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus in terms of their accuracies in hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Computational experiments reveal that BOUNDER outperforms the PCA and filtering based approach by providing the highest accuracy in 6 out of 9 datasets while providing more interpretable results through a correlation analysis. The BOUNDER algorithm is also shown to be more robust when compared to multiple other conventional dimension reduction algorithms across different datasets.","2019-04-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","348-357","","","130","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","Estimating gene expression from high-dimensional DNA methylation levels in cancer data","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Beta distribution; Big data analytics; Dimension reduction algorithm; DNA methylation data; Piece linear curve fitting; Values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of the present study is to gain insight into the wear characteristics of such tribo-pairs operating in dry conditions and to develop a general procedure to reliably predict their useful life. Results are presented based on a series of experiments performed using a ball-on-disk tribometer. The disk is made of brass coated with a black paint to clearly detect the onset of failure defined as the time when the steel ball contacts the brass disk and friction force rapidly fluctuates and becomes erratic. First, experiments are performed at various loads (1 N, 2 N and 3 N) at a constant sliding speed (0.1 m/s), and different sliding speeds (0.05 m/s, 0.1 m/s and 0.2 m/s) at a constant load of 2 N) for establishing the useful life. Following these experiments, fluctuating operating conditions are imposed by varying (i) loading sequence, (ii) sliding speed sequence and (iii) both load and sliding speed in an arbitrary manner. For all these experiments the remaining useful life for the last sequence are determined by considering Miner's constant C = 1 and cumulative power to failure of 103 W. The results revealed that the maximum error between the power generation method and experimental results vary from 2% to 10.3%, while using Miner's constant, the error was substantially higher. Further, the applicability of power generation method is validated for an extreme operating condition for an Al-steel tribo-pair.

Here, we demonstrate an approach for building multi-level causal models. A hierarchical approach is proposed to capture both cyclic and non-cyclic features of a process plant. Decoupling these features of the plant by constructing two tiers of digraphs, one tier representing overall plant and the other representing individual subsystems, helps in better inference of causal relations present in the system. An algorithm that subsides the effects of indirect causal interactions using reachability matrix and adjacency matrix ideas is also proposed.

Their efficiency depends on the quality of training data, which is a disadvantage in the case of medical data that are often imperfect (e.g. incomplete, imbalanced, uncertain). Moreover, numerous classifiers are black-boxes from the perspective of diagnosticians who perform the final diagnoses. These drawbacks degrade the potential usefulness of classifiers in diagnosis support. A rule-based reasoning may overcome these mentioned limitations. We introduce both a rule selection and a diagnosis support method based on the Dempster–Shafer and fuzzy set theories. The theories can manage an interpretation of incomplete and imbalanced data, imprecision of medical information and knowledge uncertainty. The usefulness of the method will be proven on a test case of liver fibrosis diagnosis. The liver fibrosis stage is difficult to recognize even for experienced physicians. The diagnosis of the liver state by an invasive biopsy is ambiguous and dependent on its finite precision. Therefore, knowledge-based methods are being sought to reduce the need of invasive testing. We use a real medical database related to patients affected by hepatitis C virus to extract knowledge. The database has missing and outlying values and patients’ diagnoses are uncertain. The proposed methods provide simple diagnostic rules that are helpful in this study of liver fibrosis and in processing deficient data. The greatest benefit and novelty of the approach is the ability to assess three stages of fibrosis in a non-invasive way, whereas other medical tests allow to detect only the last stage, i.e. the cirrhosis.","2018-11-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","67-79","","","76","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Dempster–Shafer theory; Diagnostic rule extraction; Liver fibrosis; Medical diagnosis support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work proposes a link between the mechanical testing and the material model predictions through histological data of vaginal tissue. Histological data was used to link tensile testing experiments with material-dependent parameters; the approach was adequate to capture the nonlinear response of ovine vaginal tissue over a large strain range. The experimental data obtained on a previous study, has two main components: tensile testing and histological analysis of the ovine vaginal tissue. Uniaxial tensile test data and histological data were collected from three sheep groups: virgins, pregnant and parous. The distal part of vaginal wall was selected since it is prone to tears induced by vaginal delivery. The HGO (Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden) model parameters were fitted using a stochastic approach, namely the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA). The SGA was able to fit the experimental data successfully (R2 > 0.986). The dimensionless coefficient ξ, was highly correlated with histological data. The ratio was seen to increase linearly with increasing collagen content. Coefficient ξ brings a new way of interpreting and understanding experimental data; it connects the nonlinear mechanical behaviour (tensile test) with tissue’s morphology (histology). It can be used as an ‘inverse’ (approximate) method to estimate the mechanical properties without direct experimental measurements, through basic histology. In this context, the proposed methodology appears very promising in estimating the response of the tissue via histological information.","2019-01-03","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","271-279","","","82","","Journal of Biomechanics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Genetic algorithm; Biomechanical properties; Histology; Hyperelastic model; Vaginal tissue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the deposition height is an important variable that, if it does not match the process growth, can bring to defects and geometrical inaccuracies in the deposited structures. The current work presents a system based on optical triangulation for the height monitoring, implemented on a LMD setup composed of a fiber laser, a deposition head, and an anthropomorphic robot. Its coaxial and non-intrusive configuration allows for flexibility in the deposition strategy and direction. A measurement laser beam is launched through the powder nozzle and hits the melt pool. A coaxial camera acquires the probe spot, whose position is converted to relative height. The device has been demonstrated for monitoring the deposition of a stainless steel cylinder. The measurements allowed to reconstruct a spatial map of the height variation, highlighting a transient in the deposition growth which can be explained in terms of a self-regulating mechanism for the layer thickness.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","136-144","","","112","","Optics and Lasers in Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; Laser metal deposition; Laser triangulation; Optical monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose the analysis of the kinematics of data probability distributions over time towards the characterization of data temporal variability. Methods First, we propose a kinematic model based on the estimation of a continuous data temporal trajectory, using Functional Data Analysis over the embedding of a non-parametric statistical manifold which points represent data temporal batches, the Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plot. This model allows measuring the velocity and acceleration of data changes. Next, we propose a coordinate-free method to characterize the oriented seasonality of data based on the parallelism of lagged velocity vectors of the data trajectory throughout the IGT space, the Auto-Parallelism of Velocity Vectors (APVV) and APVVmap. Finally, we automatically explain the maximum variance components of the IGT space coordinates by means of correlating data points with known temporal factors from the domain application. Materials Methods are evaluated on the US National Hospital Discharge Survey open dataset, consisting of 3,25M hospital discharges between 2000 and 2010. Results Seasonal and abrupt behaviours were present on the estimated multivariate and univariate data trajectories. The kinematic analysis revealed seasonal effects and punctual increments in data celerity, the latter mainly related to abrupt changes in coding. The APVV and APVVmap revealed oriented seasonal changes on data trajectories. For most variables, their distributions tended to change to the same direction at a 12-month period, with a peak of change of directionality at mid and end of the year. Diagnosis and Procedure codes also included a 9-month periodic component. Kinematics and APVV methods were able to detect seasonal effects on extreme temporal subgrouped data, such as in Procedure code, where Fourier and autocorrelation methods were not able to. The automated explanation of IGT space coordinates was consistent with the results provided by the kinematic and seasonal analysis. Coordinates received different meanings according to the trajectory trend, seasonality and abrupt changes. Discussion Treating data as a particle moving over time through a multidimensional probabilistic space and studying the kinematics of its trajectory has turned out to a new temporal variability methodology. Its results on the NHDS were aligned with the dataset and population descriptions found in the literature, contributing with a novel temporal variability characterization. We have demonstrated that the APVV and APVVmat are an appropriate tool for the coordinate-free and oriented analysis of trajectories or complex multivariate signals. Conclusion The proposed methods comprise an exploratory methodology for the characterization of data temporal variability, what may be useful for a reliable reuse of Big Biomedical Data repositories acquired over long periods of time.","2018-11-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","109-124","","","119","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","Kinematics of Big Biomedical Data to characterize temporal variability and seasonality of data repositories","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Big data; Time series; Coordinate-free; Data quality; Data reuse; Functional data analysis; Seasonality; Statistical manifolds; Temporal stability; Trajectories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tapping on these already available data for additional purposes, aiming at improving care, without significant incremental effort and cost. This potential of secondary patient data is explored through modeling administrative and billing data, as well as the hierarchical structure of pathology codes of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the prediction of unplanned readmissions, as a clinically relevant outcome parameter that can be impacted on in a quality improvement program. Methods In this single-center, hospital-wide observational cohort study, we included all adult patients discharged in 2016 after applying an exclusion protocol (n = 29,702). In addition to administrative variables, such as age and length of stay, structured pathology data were taken into account in predictive models. As a first research question, we compared logistic regression against penalized logistic regression, gradient boosting and Random Forests to predict unplanned readmission. As a second research goal, we investigated the level of hierarchy within the pathology data needed to achieve the best accuracy. Finally, we investigated which prediction variables play a prominent role in predicting hospital readmission. The performance of all models was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) measure. Results All models have the best predictive results using Random Forests. An added value of 7% is observed compared to a baseline method such as logistic regression. The best model, based on Random Forests, achieved an AUC of 0.77, using the diagnosis category and procedure code as lowest level of the hierarchical pathology data. Conclusions The most accurate model to predict hospital wide unplanned readmission is based on Random Forests and includes the ICD hierarchy, especially diagnosis category. Such an approach lowers the number of predictor variables and yields a higher interpretability than a model based on a detailed diagnosis. The performance of the model proved high enough to be used as a decision support tool.","2019-05-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:17","177-183","","","173","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Machine learning; Boosting; Decision support; ICD-10 diagnosis; Random Forests; Readmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have reinforced the hypothesis that the prion paradigm–the templated growth and spreading of misfolded proteins–could help explain the progression of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. However, our current understanding of prion-like growth and spreading is rather empirical. Here we show that a physics-based reaction-diffusion model can explain the growth and spreading of misfolded protein in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To characterize the progression of misfolded proteins across the brain, we combine the classical Fisher–Kolmogorov equation for population dynamics with an anisotropic diffusion model and simulate misfolding across a sagittal section and across the entire brain. In a systematic sensitivity analysis, we probe the role of the individual model parameters and show that the misfolded protein concentration is sensitive to the coefficients of growth, extracellular diffusion, and axonal transport, to the axonal fiber orientation, and to the initial seeding region. Our model correctly predicts amyloid-β deposits and tau inclusions in Alzheimer’s disease, α-synuclein inclusions in Parkinson’s disease, and TDP-43 inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and displays excellent agreement with the histological patterns in diseased human brains. When integrated across the brain, our concentration profiles result in biomarker curves that display a striking similarity with the sigmoid shape and qualitative timeline of clinical biomarker models. Our results suggest that misfolded proteins in various neurodegenerative disorders grow and spread according to a universal law that follows the basic physical principles of nonlinear reaction and anisotropic diffusion. Our findings substantiate the notion of a common underlying principle for the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders, the prion paradigm. A more quantitative understanding of the growth and spreading of misfolded amyloid-β, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 would allow us to establish a prognostic timeframe of disease progression. This could have important clinical implications, ranging from more accurate estimates of the socioeconomic burden of neurodegeneration to a more informed design of clinical trials and pharmacological intervention.","2019-03-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","264-281","","","124","","Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Biomarker; Continuum modeling; Neurodegeneration; Prion; Reaction diffusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge of their radiative properties is a prerequisite for laser based diagnostics of soot. In this parametric study, the effect of primary particle polydispersity on soot aggregate absorption and scattering properties is investigated numerically. Two series of fractal aggregates formed by normal and lognormal distributed primary particles of different levels of standard deviation were numerically generated for typical flame soot with a fractal dimension and prefactor fixed to Df=1.73 and kf ≈ 1.5, respectively. Three aggregate sizes consisting of Np=15, 50 and 150 monomers per aggregate were investigated. Due to the uncertainty in soot refractive index, radiative properties were calculated by considering two different refractive indices at λ ≈ 532 nm recommended in the literature using the Discrete Dipoles Approximation and the Generalized Multiparticle Mie method. The results are interpreted in terms of correction factors to the Rayleigh–Debye–Gans theory for fractal aggregates (RDG-FA) for the forward scattering cross section A and for the absorption cross section h. It is shown that differential cross section for vertically polarized incident light, total scattering and absorption cross sections are well predicted by the RDG-FA theory for all considered aggregates formed by normally (σ/dp¯≤ 30%) and lognormally (σgeo ≤  1.6) distributed primary particles. The refractive index is found to be of greater impact than primary particle polydispersity on the importance of multiple scattering. The radiative force per unit laser power experienced by the soot aggregates was found primarily determined by the aggregate volume, regardless of the level of primary particle polydispersity.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","1151-1159","","1","37","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Discrete dipole approximation; Generalized multi-sphere Mie; Laser light scattering by soot; Polydisperse primary particles; Radiative properties of soot aggregates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pilot fuel was admitted using a coaxial single-hole 100 µm injector mounted on the cylinder periphery. Optical diagnostics include combined high-speed CH2O-PLIF (10 kHz) and Schlieren (80 kHz) imaging for detection of the first-stage ignition, and simultaneous high-speed OH* chemiluminescence (40 kHz) imaging for high-temperature ignition. The aim of this study is to enhance the fundamental understanding of the interaction of methane with the auto-ignition process of short pilot-fuel injections. Addition of methane into the air charge considerably prolongs ignition delay of the pilot spray with an increasing effect at lower temperatures and with higher methane/air equivalence ratios. The temporal separation of the first CH2O detection and high-temperature ignition was found almost constant regardless of methane content. This was interpreted as methane mostly deferring the cool-flame reactivity. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of this interaction, experimental investigations were complemented with 1D-flamelet simulations using detailed chemistry, confirming the chemical influence of methane deferring the reactivity in the pilot-fuel lean mixtures. This shifts the onset of first-stage reactivity towards the fuel-richer conditions. Consequently, the onset of the turbulent cool-flame is delayed, leading to an overall increased high-temperature ignition delay. Overall, the study reveals a complex interplay between entrainment, low T and high T chemistry and micro-mixing for dual-fuel auto-ignition processes for which the governing processes were identified.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","4741-4749","","4","37","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","CHO-PLIF; Auto-ignition; Cool-flame; Dual-fuel combustion; Turbulence-chemistry interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is necessary for tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and post-operative assessment. A common approach to localize multiple landmarks is to combine multiple independent localizers for individual landmarks with a spatial regularizer, e.g., a conditional random field (CRF). Its configuration, e.g., the CRF topology and potential functions, often has to be manually specified w.r.t. the application. In this paper, we present a general framework to automatically learn the optimal configuration of a CRF for localizing multiple landmarks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel “missing” label for each landmark (node in the CRF). The key idea is to define a pool of potentials and optimize their CRF weights and the potential values for missing landmarks in a learning framework.

This approach to predict the fractional flow reserve (FFR) is shown to have a high diagnostic accuracy when comparing against invasively measured FFR. However, one of the main drawbacks is the high computational effort needed for preprocessing and computations. Hence, uncertainty quantification may become unfeasible. Reduction of complexity is desirable, computationally inexpensive models with high diagnostic accuracy are preferred. We present a parametric comparison study for three types of CFD models (2D axisymmetric, Semi-3D and 3D) in which we study the impact of model reduction on three models on the predicted FFR. In total 200 coronary geometries were generated for seven geometrical characteristics e.g. stenosis severity, stenosis length and vessel curvature. The effect of time-averaged flow was investigated using unsteady, mean steady and a root mean square (RMS) steady flow. The 3D unsteady model was regarded as reference model. Results show that when using an unsteady or RMS flow, predicted FFR hardly varies between models contrary to using average flows. The 2D model with RMS flow has a high diagnostic accuracy (0.99), reduces computational time by a factor 162,000 and the introduced model error is well below the clinical relevant differences. Stenosis severity, length, curvature and tapering cause most discrepancies when using a lower order model. An uncertainty analysis showed that this can be explained by the low variability that is caused by variations in stenosis asymmetry.","2019-01-03","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","313-323","","","82","","Journal of Biomechanics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Computational fluid dynamics; Fractional flow reserve; Model order reduction; Uncertainty quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The burner operating with methane as fuel exhibits a convergent-divergent flow field and is capable of stabilizing a non-sooty flame at ultra-low global equivalence ratio (ϕglob) down to 0.1. At 1.0 > ϕglob > 0.6, the flame stabilizes in the diverging section where the flow field is characterized predominantly by the swirl. The flame stabilizes at locations of low velocity and low turbulence where the mean flow strain rates are found to be well below the extinctions strain rates for turbulent non-premixed flames. With decreasing ϕglob, the flame is located progressively near the burner lip, where a large recirculation zone of the central bluff body in the burner exists. The transition from swirl stabilized to bluffbody stabilized region occurs between 0.6 > ϕglob > 0.4 and bi-stability of the flame with low-frequency oscillation between the two stabilization locations was observed. The upstream marching of the flame, despite a decreasing ϕglob, and a corresponding decrease in heat input, is explained in terms of the interaction of the flame front with the evolution of the scalar profile upstream, in presence of the recirculating hot gases. The results support flame stabilization theories based on partial premixing and flow modification through heat release upstream of the flame. For the leaner conditions, 0.4 > ϕglob > 0.1, the flame is stabilizing in a region characterized by bluffbody induced toroidal flow structures of high strain rates, where the presence of recirculating hot burned gases aid in flame stabilization by the ignition of flammable mixture.","2018-10-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","466-477","","","196","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Laser diagnostics; High-speed diagnostics; Swirl flows; Ultra-lean combustion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the dynamic interaction between the gas phase and liquid phase of the flash boiling sprays has not been adequately investigated yet. This work adopts a two-dimensional optical transparent nozzle to study in-nozzle multiphase flow characteristics as well as spray characteristics outside of the nozzle. Both high-speed and low-speed measurements were carried out using optical diagnostic methods, and flash boiling sprays at different superheat levels were studied. With the experiments, the correlation between the internal flow and spray liquid jet breakup is established and the impact of the gas-liquid correlation on the properties of flash boiling sprays is presented. Furthermore, dynamic interaction between the gas phase and liquid phase in the nozzle and out of the nozzle is analyzed with a center of mass scheme. It is found that the dynamic features of the flash boiling sprays are closely connected with the dynamics of the in-nozzle flow.

Cases similar to the query are retrieved from the database, and then their solutions are adapted to the query. In medicine, a case usually corresponds to a patient and the problem consists of classifying the patient in a class of diagnostic or therapy. Compared to “black box” algorithms such as deep learning, the responses of CBR systems can be justified easily using the similar cases as examples. However, this possibility is often under-exploited and the explanations provided by most CBR systems are limited to the display of the similar cases. In this paper, we propose a CBR method that can be both executed automatically as an algorithm and presented visually in a user interface for providing visual explanations or for visual reasoning. After retrieving similar cases, a visual interface displays quantitative and qualitative similarities between the query and the similar cases, so as one can easily classify the query through visual reasoning, in a fully explainable manner. It combines a quantitative approach (visualized by a scatter plot based on Multidimensional Scaling in polar coordinates, preserving distances involving the query) and a qualitative approach (set visualization using rainbow boxes). We applied this method to breast cancer management. We showed on three public datasets that our qualitative method has a classification accuracy comparable to k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, but is better explainable. We also tested the proposed interface during a small user study. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a real dataset in breast cancer.

Anomaly detection, which does not make any assumption about the shape of a potential attack but instead on legitimate behavior, seems to be a suitable approach in order to defeat sophisticated intrusions. Skip-gram modeling, a word2vec algorithm variant, was leveraged to model systems’ legitimate network behavior. The resulting model was then used to spot intrusions in a test dataset. The optimal configuration led to 99.20% precision, 82.07% recall, and 91.02% accuracy, with a false positive rate of 0.61%, which is significantly lower than most state-of-the-art methods. These metrics were achieved under a fully unsupervised setting, that is, without any prior knowledge of what constitutes an attack.

The success of smart healthcare applications such as clinical decision support systems, disease diagnosis systems, and healthcare management systems depends on knowledge that is understandable by machines to interpret and infer new knowledge from it. In this regard, ontological data models are expected to play a vital role to organize, integrate, and make informative inferences with the knowledge implicit in that unstructured data and represent the resultant knowledge in a form that machines can understand. However, constructing such models is challenging because they demand intensive labor, domain experts, and ontology engineers. Such requirements impose a limit on the scale or scope of ontological data models. We present a framework that will allow mitigating the time-intensity to build ontologies and achieve machine interoperability. Methods: Empowered by linked biomedical ontologies, our proposed novel Automated Ontology Generation Framework consists of five major modules: a) Text Processing using compute on demand approach. b) Medical Semantic Annotation using N-Gram, ontology linking and classification algorithms, c) Relation Extraction using graph method and Syntactic Patterns, d), Semantic Enrichment using RDF mining, e) Domain Inference Engine to build the formal ontology. Results: Quantitative evaluations show 84.78% recall, 53.35% precision, and 67.70% F-measure in terms of disease-drug concepts identification; 85.51% recall, 69.61% precision, and F-measure 76.74% with respect to taxonomic relation extraction; and 77.20% recall, 40.10% precision, and F-measure 52.78% with respect to biomedical non-taxonomic relation extraction. Conclusion: We present an automated ontology generation framework that is empowered by Linked Biomedical Ontologies.

Thus, development and validation of realistic synthetic diagnostics is necessary for increasing confidence in existing models and future diagnostic designs. Recent development in AFSI includes physical corrections such as implementation of plasma rotation and reduction of the fast particle contribution in thermal reactant distribution. The rotation typically changes the beam-thermal reaction rates by 1–5%, while accounting for the fast particle density consistently reduces the neutron deficit (widely known inequality of the measured and calculated neutron rates) by up to 15% depending on the discharge. Further developments include implementation of angular dependence of DD differential fusion cross sections and accounting for finite Larmor radius effect, which is important for high-energy particles such as ICRH.

Four different diagnostics have been used: gas chromatography (GC), chemiluminescence NOx analyzer, continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the case of the oxidation of neat methane, the onset temperature for CH4 oxidation was above 1025 K, while it is shifted to 825 K with the addition of NO2 or NO, independently of equivalence ratio, indicating that the addition of NO2 or NO highly promotes CH4 oxidation. The consumption rate of CH4 exhibits a similar trend with the presence of both NO2 and NO. The amount of produced HCN has been quantified and a search for HONO and CH3NO2 species has been attempted. A detailed kinetic mechanism, derived from POLIMI kinetic framework, has been used to interpret the experimental data with a good agreement between experimental data and model predictions. Reaction rate and sensitivity analysis have been conducted to illustrate the kinetic regimes. The fact that the addition of NO or NO2 seems to have similar effects on promoting CH4 oxidation can be explained by the fact that both species are involved in a reaction cycle interchanging them and whose result is 2CH3 + O2 = 2CH2O + 2H. Additionally, the direct participation of NO2 in the NO2 + CH2O = HONO + HCO reaction has a notable accelerating effect on methane oxidation.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","667-675","","1","37","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Jet-stirred reactor; Low-temperature oxidation; NO methane combustion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still they may also give rise to strong flame dynamics and harmful combustion instabilities. In order to improve our control on such systems, multi-stage multi-injection burners offer additional degrees of freedom in the fuel distribution and thus in the combustion regime. The BIMER combustor has been expressly developed by EM2C to investigate this solution at a laboratory scale. It is composed of two swirling stages: the pilot stage, in which liquid fuel is injected through a pressure-swirl atomizer; and the multipoint stage, in which the fuel is injected through 10 holes in a jet-in-crossflow configuration. Successive experimental campaigns demonstrated the key-role played by fuel distribution in the two stages and clearly showed the existence of an hysteresis cycle: several flame stabilization archetypes can exist for the same fuel distribution, depending on the flow, spray and flame history. In-depth analysis through numerous experimental diagnostics permitted to elaborate several scenarii to explain this complex behavior. In the present study, large eddy simulations are carried out with the AVBP code to complement the experimental data in our understanding of the burner stabilization processes. Simulations from full pilot to full multipoint injections are performed, exhibiting the hysteresis cycle observed in the experiments. An original tri-stable point was also encountered for full pilot injection, with three possible flame shapes. This tri-stable point is investigated and the impact of fuel staging for a given flame shape is analyzed. The two bifurcations observed experimentally are finally presented and analyzed along with their inherent mechanisms.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","5245-5253","","4","37","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bifurcation; Large eddy simulation; Turbulent spray flame; Two-stage combustor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once appropriate models are identified, they can be used for applications such as response prediction, structural control, monitoring structural integrity, lifetime prognosis, etc. The number of models and model classes available to the modeler to represent a physical phenomenon, however, can be very large. Retaining all available models throughout a study can be computationally burdensome, so the modeler has the significant problem of identifying the valid models to be used in further studies. To address this challenge, a probabilistic framework is proposed herein for validating models by intertwining the concepts of model falsification and Bayesian model selection. Model falsification, based on the philosophy that measurements can only be used to falsify models, is used in this framework in both pre- and postprocessing steps to eliminate models and model classes, respectively, that cannot explain the measurements. This is the first study to propose a framework to integrate these two paradigms. A likelihood-bound model falsification, previously introduced by the authors, determines the validity of the initial candidate model classes, using the false discovery rate (FDR), and removes most of the incorrect ones without incurring any significant additional computational burden. Next, Bayesian model selection, which assigns posterior model class probabilities based on Bayes’ theorem, is applied to the remaining model classes to identify the model(s) and model class(es) that provide predictions that probabilistically best fit the data. Finally, a postprocessing likelihood-bound falsification checks the validity of the final model class(es). The proposed framework is first illustrated through two nonlinear structural dynamics examples that show the efficacy of the proposed framework in identifying models for these structures as well as reducing the computational burden relative to Bayesian model selection applied alone. Finally, a third example uses measurement data from experiments performed on a full-scale four-story base-isolated building at the world’s largest shake table in Japan’s “E-Defense” laboratory.","2019-04-15","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","961-980","","","121","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bayesian model selection; False discovery rate (FDR); Model falsification; Model validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the results of a research in hybrid fault diagnosis techniques that utilizes support vector machine (SVM) and improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) to perform further diagnosis on the basis of qualitative reasoning by knowledge-based preliminary diagnosis and sample data provided by an on-line simulation model. Further, SVM has relatively good classification ability with small samples compared to other machine learning methodologies. However, there are some challenges in the selection of hyper-parameters in SVM that warrants the adoption of intelligent optimization algorithms. Hence, the major contribution of this paper is to propose a hybrid fault diagnosis method with a comprehensive and reasonable design.

It has been observed that during the flame drifting to downstream, there is no obvious shifting on the mixture fraction.

The developed models are formulated for the reservoir and wellbore domains based on mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The non-Darcy law is applied to the numerical models, and radial flow in the hydraulic fractures is accounted for when the reservoir and wellbore models are coupled. These developed models are solved numerically by the finite difference method. Then, synthetic cases demonstrate the models’ ability to predict the temperature behavior and clarify the change regularity of the wellbore temperature profile for an MFHW in an LPGR. The effects of pressure interference among hydraulic fractures on the inflow rate are analyzed. Based on the sensitivity of arriving temperature to the fracture parameters, an approach to plotting fracture parameter diagnosis charts are introduced.

With the emergence of m-Health devices, the importance of automatic detection of AF in an off-clinic setting is growing. This study demonstrates the performance of a bimodal classifier for distinguishing AF from sinus rhythm (SR) that could be used for automated detection of AF episodes. Methods Surface recordings from a hand-held research device and standard electrocardiograms (ECG) were collected and analyzed from 68 subjects. An additional 48 subjects from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database were also analyzed. All ECGs were blindly reviewed by physicians independently of the bimodal algorithm analysis. The algorithm selects an artifact-free 6-s ECG segment out of a 20-s long recording and computes a spectral Frequency Dispersion Metric (FDM) and a temporal R-R interval variability (VRR) index. Results Scatter plots of the VRR and FDM indices revealed two distinct clusters. The bimodal scattering of the indices revealed a linear classification boundary that could be employed to differentiate the SR from AF waveforms. The selected classification boundary was able to correctly differentiate all the subjects from both datasets into either SR or AF groups, except for 3 SR subjects from the MIT-BIH dataset.

In this study, we investigate the biomechanics of fetal movements in such situations, namely fetal breech position, oligohydramnios and primiparity (firstborn pregnancy). We also investigate twin pregnancies, which are not at greater risk of DDH incidence, despite the more restricted intra-uterine environment. We track fetal movements for each of these situations using cine-MRI technology, quantify the kick and muscle forces, and characterise the resulting stress and strain in the hip joint, testing the hypothesis that altered biomechanical stimuli may explain the link between certain intra-uterine conditions and risk of DDH. Kick force, stress and strain were found to be significantly lower in cases of breech position and oligohydramnios. Similarly, firstborn fetuses were found to generate significantly lower kick forces than non-firstborns. Interestingly, no significant difference was observed in twins compared to singletons. This research represents the first evidence of a link between the biomechanics of fetal movements and the risk of DDH, potentially informing the development of future preventative measures and enhanced diagnosis.

Remotely monitoring patients using wearable sensors has an important role to play in health care, particularly given the prevalence of chronic conditions such as premature ventricular contraction (PVC), one of the prominent causes of death world-wide. PVC is a serious cardiovascular condition that can lead to life-threatening conditions. The instant recognition of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias based on a wearable ECG sensor for a few seconds is a challenging problem of clinical significance. Method Twenty seconds of consecutive ECG beats that were identified empirically to characterise a PVC episode were analysed. Three morphological features and seven statistical features were directly extracted in real time. These features were normalized and fed into an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier for classification. The PVC detector was uploaded into a smartphone to classify each episode as either PVC or non-PVC. Results The proposed algorithm was tested on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics (INCART) and Shimmer3 ECG databases. The proposed method resulted in an improved sensitivity, positive predictive value and accuracy of 98.7%, 97.8% and 98.6% respectively compared to recently published methods. In addition, the proposed method is suitable for real-time patient monitoring as it is computationally simple and requires only a few seconds of ECG recording to detect a PVC rhythm.

For the available dataset, the performance of the two detection schemes is similar (the area under ROC curve is 0.98 for the combination of three biomarkers) and the Bayesian approach has the advantage that its outputs (parameters estimates and their uncertainty) can be further analysed by a clinical expert.","2018-09-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","86-93","","","46","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Recurrent neural networks; Ovarian cancer; Bayesian estimation; Biomarkers; Change-point detection; Gibbs sampling; Markov chain; Monte Carlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mole fraction of CO2 addition ranged from 0 to 0.5, while the flow rate of the fuel gas was kept constant for these two sets of flames. Spatial distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), temperature, as well as volume fraction, primary particle size and number density of soot were observed by the methods of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), ratio pyrometry and laser-induced incandescence (LII), respectively. It was found that the flame height decreased for ethylene flames while it was nearly constant for propane flames with increasing addition of CO2. The measurements showed a temperature reduction in the lower part but an increase in the upper part in the ethylene-based flames. By contrast, a slight temperature decrease was observed in overall propane-based flames with the addition of CO2. Similar suppression effects were observed in the total soot/PAHs loading, percentage of carbon conversion to soot, and the total number of primary soot particles regardless of the fuel type. Comparison between the total loading of soot and PAHs indicated that addition of CO2 inhibited the conversion of PAHs to soot. The results also showed that the addition of CO2 in the fuel had a small effect on the specific growth rate of soot regardless of the fuel type. Relative changes of particle surface area could reasonably well explain the shift in the peak volume fraction from the wings to the centerline with the addition of CO2 to the ethylene flames.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","85-95","","","199","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Ethylene; Carbon dioxide; Optical diagnostics; Propane; Soot evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research attempts to model the spatial-temporal travel patterns based on spatial point pattern theory. Using a twelve-day private automobile data set collected in Beijing, we systematically investigate the temporal variations of trip-destination distributions, and their association with city spatial structure. The availability of detailed POIs (Points of Interest) data enables us to study the effect of city structure on travel pattern at a refined level. Four types of inhomogeneous Poisson point process models are built to capture the impacts on human mobility posed by spatial covariates. Residual analysis, inhomogeneous K function and leverage diagnostic tools are further adopted to validate the model performance and determine the best fitted model. The validation results indicate that the proposed model reasonably explains the travel patterns in both holiday and workday throughout the city. The inclusion of Cartesian coordinates, population distribution, and city subdivision-category improves the model performance. The empirical results based on the dataset also reveal the differences in impacts on travel patterns posed by underlying city structure between holidays and weekdays as well as between citywide districts. The modeling method and the exploratory spatial–temporal analysis in this study can offer complementary techniques for traffic management and urban planning.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","68-84","","","73","","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Urban spatial structure and travel patterns","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Inhomogeneous Poisson model; Land use; Points of interest; Spatial point pattern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, measurement techniques with high spatio-temporal resolution have to be applied to test cases with well-defined boundary conditions in order to generate high-quality validation data for numerical simulations. In the current paper, the auto-ignition of a transient propane jet-in-hot coflow was studied with high-speed OH* chemiluminescence imaging and high-speed Rayleigh scattering for the simultaneous determination of mixture fraction, mixture temperature and scalar dissipation rate immediately prior to the onset of auto-ignition. A variation of the coflow temperature showed a pronounced temperature dependence of the auto-ignition location and time, and the temperature sensitivity was higher than for a comparable methane test case from the literature. This is explained by the lower sensitivity of propane ignition delay times to the local strain rate in comparison to methane. The Rayleigh measurements however showed that the formation mechanism of auto-ignition kernels is similar for propane and methane. Ignition kernels were found to form upstream of bulges of the inflowing jet at locations with locally low scalar dissipation rate.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2117-2124","","2","37","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Auto-ignition; Boundary conditions; High-speed laser diagnostics; Jet-in-Hot-Coflow; Rayleigh scattering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explain this mechanism, we propose a cell interaction phenomenon in which one cell experiences fuel starvation. A specific voltage distribution along the straight channel direction has been observed with an innovative multipoint monitoring method. This phenomenon also can be used for fuel starvation diagnosis. This study proposes an ingenious simplified two-chamber model to analyze the current and voltage redistribution mechanism under fuel starvation. The reliability of this model has been validated in this paper. The model shows that current convergence resulted by fuel starvation in one cell can lead to a concomitant local current convergence in nearby normal cells. Based on our calculation, >85% of reaction current concentrates in the anode inlet region of the fuel-starved cell, resulting in a 70% current convergence in the two adjacent normal cells. A serious corrosion of the fuel-starved cell is observed in the post-mortem study. The faulty cell presents a 5° contact angle decrease and a 28% ECSA loss. Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy results show that the decline of anode outlet regions’ cathode catalyst layers are more serious. Some optimal strategies have been proposed to solve this problem.","2018-10-15","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","465-474","","","174","","Energy Conversion and Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cell flooding; Cell interaction; Current density difference; Diagnosis method; Fuel starvation; PEM fuel cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research aims to apply computational methods to recognize main diseases in coffee leaves, with the purpose to implement an expert system to assist coffee producers in disease diagnosis during its initial stages. Since these two diseases are shapeless, it inspires a texture attribute extraction approach for pattern recognition. Two texture attributes were considered in this work: statistical attributes and local binary patterns. The texture attribute vector were computed for a collection of images of coffee leaves and used as input to a feedforward neural network. The results were compared with the recognition rate of a convolutional neural network with deep learning applied directly to the same collection of images, without extraction of texture attributes. Surprisingly, this second approach showed better results than the texture extraction method. It could be explained by the small number of diseases we aimed to recognize and a sufficient number of training samples used during the deep learning process. The best Kappa coefficient obtained was 0.970, and sensitivity was 0.980.","2019-01-01","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","2021-06-05 17:31:18","135-144","","","159","","Procedia Computer Science","","Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference KES2019","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnosis; cercospora; coffee leaf disease; Image Processing; rust; Thermography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
