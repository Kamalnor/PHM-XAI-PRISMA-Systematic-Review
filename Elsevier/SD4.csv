This allows for a better decision support by considering the anticipated time-to-failure and thus promises to reduce costs. Here a common baseline may be derived by fitting a probability density function to past lifetimes and then utilizing the (conditional) expected remaining useful life as a prognostic. This approach finds widespread use in practice because of its high explanatory power. A more accurate alternative is promised by machine learning, where forecasts incorporate deterioration processes and environmental variables through sensor data. However, machine learning largely functions as a black-box method and its forecasts thus forfeit most of the desired interpretability. As our primary contribution, we propose a structured-effect neural network for predicting the remaining useful life which combines the favorable properties of both approaches: its key innovation is that it offers both a high accountability and the flexibility of deep learning. The parameters are estimated via variational Bayesian inferences. The different approaches are compared based on the actual time-to-failure for aircraft engines. This demonstrates the performance and superior interpretability of our method, while we finally discuss implications for decision support.","2019-10-01","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-15 08:09:37","2021-06-05 17:46:10","113100","","","125","","Decision Support Systems","Forecasting remaining useful life","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\QRVEP55H\Kraus and Feuerriegel - 2019 - Forecasting remaining useful life Interpretable d.pdf","","","Neural networks; Deep learning; Machine learning; Forecasting; Remaining useful life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) framework that automatically identifies NATM construction works using low-cost site surveillance images. The framework adopts the Bayesian statistics to combine the prior NATM construction knowledge with the visual evidence extracted by deep learning (DL) based computer vision models. The analysis results of Site CCTV surveillance videos of four NATM tunneling projects are presented to demonstrate its ability (i) to label NATM work cycles from the work timeline, (ii) to identify NATM work categories inside each work cycle, and (iii) to estimate the degree of plan-work deviation at the construction cycle level. The proposed framework yields promising results on a real NATM tunneling project.","2020-11-01","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:10","103558","","","105","","Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology","Integrating domain knowledge with deep learning models","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Computer vision; NATM project monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fact that these clinical documents are written in regular natural language makes the automatic coding process difficult because, often, spontaneous terms diverge strongly from standard reference terminology such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Objective Our aim is to propose a general and multilingual approach to render Diagnostic Terms into the standard framework provided by the ICD. We have evaluated our proposal on a set of clinical texts written in French, Hungarian and Italian. Methods ICD-10 encoding is a multi-class classification problem with an extensive (thousands) number of classes. After considering several approaches, we tackle our objective as a sequence-to-sequence task. According to current trends, we opted to use neural networks. We tested different types of neural architectures on three datasets in which Diagnostic Terms (DTs) have their ICD-10 codes associated. Results and conclusions Our results give a new state-of-the art on multilingual ICD-10 coding, outperforming several alternative approaches, and showing the feasibility of automatic ICD-10 prediction obtaining an F-measure of 0.838, 0.963 and 0.952 for French, Hungarian and Italian, respectively. Additionally, the results are interpretable, providing experts with supporting evidence when confronted with coding decisions, as the model is able to show the alignments between the original text and each output code.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:10","49-59","","","129","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Electronic health records; International Classification of Diseases; Neural machine translation; Sequence-to-sequence mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EasyMiner offers a visual interface designed for interactivity, allowing the user to define a constraining pattern for the mining task. The CBA algorithm can also be used for pruning of the rule set, thus addressing the common problem of “too many rules” on the output, and the implementation supports automatic tuning of confidence and support thresholds. The development version additionally supports anomaly detection (FPI and its variations) and linked data mining (AMIE+).

Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as ‘weight low’ or ‘glucose level high’ while describing symptoms. This paper proposes an approach by performing data-driven learning of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule bases for clinical decision support. The approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, capable of capturing simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the framework of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), thereby further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents. Experimental studies on popular medical data benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed work is able to learn compact rule bases involving simple rule antecedents, with statistically better or comparable performance to those achieved by state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.","2021-01-01","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:16","2021-06-05 17:46:10","101986","","","111","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clinical decision support; Fuzzy rule-based systems; Medical diagnostic systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
