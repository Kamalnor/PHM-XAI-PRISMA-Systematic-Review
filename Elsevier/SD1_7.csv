The weld quality was summarized as four levels, namely poor, good, excellent and expulsion, and each level corresponded to one kind of facial expression. By visual judgment, good or bad welds were identified accurately and rapidly even though the weld was made under abnormal welding conditions.

The distribution function of the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescent contrast coefficient values are a function of the normal distribution for most of the studied fluorophores and the redox ratio. The effects of various physiological (different content of skin melanin) and technical (characteristics of optical filters) factors on the measurement results were additionally studied.

However, because of the intensive labour involved in measuring Ψstem, alternative methods are desirable. The experiment described was conducted in Murcia (Spain) with adult peach trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch cv. Flordastar) submitted to different drip irrigation treatments, measuring Ψstem with a pressure chamber and the soil water content with a neutron probe. Agro-meteorological variables were recorded. Seasonal patterns of stem water potential provide a useful diagnostic tool for irrigation management in peach trees. Rainfall events and the meteorological conditions prevailing in autumn pointed to the resilient nature of the peach cultivar studied. Fitting Ψstem by linear regression analysis as a function of soil and atmosphere yielded a significant correlation, with the soil water content being the main contributor to estimating Ψstem. Linear regression analysis highlighted the importance of considering plant water status as a function of the peach tree cultivar, the atmospheric conditions in which it develops and the soil water conditions resulting from irrigation. A multiple linear regression equation based on soil water content in the soil profile, mean daily air vapour pressure deficit (VPDm) and growing degree hours (GDH) data explained 72% of the variance in Ψstem, and is proposed as an alternative to the field measurement of Ψstem.","2015-06-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","7-13","","","114","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\H5Q2E7U7\S0168169915000617.html","","","Drip-irrigation management; Peach trees; Soil water content; Stem water potential estimation; Vapour pressure deficit; Water relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent findings show that the diversification of colony morphology may be indicative of the expression of virulence factors and increased resistance to antibiotic therapeutics. To transform these findings, and upcoming results, into a valuable clinical decision making tool, colony morphology characterisation should be standardised. Notably, it is important to establish the minimum experimental information necessary to contextualise the environment that originated the colony morphology, and describe the main morphological features associated unambiguously. Results This paper presents MorphoCol, a new ontology-based tool for the standardised, consistent and machine-interpretable description of the morphology of colonies formed by human pathogenic bacteria. The Colony Morphology Ontology (CMO) is the first controlled vocabulary addressing the specificities of the morphology of clinically significant bacteria, whereas the MorphoCol publicly Web-accessible knowledgebase is an end-user means to search and compare CMO annotated colony morphotypes. Its ultimate aim is to help correlate the morphological alterations manifested by colony-forming bacteria during infection with their response to the antimicrobial treatments administered. Conclusions MorphoCol is the first tool to address bacterial colony morphotyping systematically and deliver a free of charge resource to the community. Hopefully, it may introduce interesting features of analysis on pathogenic behaviour and play a significant role in clinical decision making.

Timeliness of outage detection as well as accuracy in finding outages on equipment in a telecommunication network depend on the monitoring system used and its performance. The intent of this paper is to investigate and propose a complementary solution to improve the performance of the existing systems in detecting faults earlier than it was able to do before. In developing our approach two constraints are given. The existing operational environment cannot be changed; threshold tuning and parameter changing cannot be done; furthermore no additional infrastructure investment has been planned. Hence, our approach relies on an alternative method based on a two-stage hybrid statistical and diagnostic detector which we designed in a way that exploits additional available data and avoids alarm monitoring system imperfections. The role of this detector is twofold: early detection of network element outages based on customer trouble calls and rule-based decision making for faulty-element isolation based on knowledge derived from fault and network management data. In this paper we present results of statistical analysis of trouble-reporting data. The analysis showed that the timing of customers' trouble reports and their content have information potential that can be utilized for early detection of outages. The detector is explained in detail and its accuracy and reduction delay is evaluated. The method presented can reduce the outage detection delay time by 2.33h on average observed in relation to the performance of an existing fault management process which was designed to detect outages solely on the basis of an alarm monitoring system, for the “difficulties in work” type of malfunction. We attained an overall probability of correct detection of 95.3%. Out of the total number of outages that hypothetically could be detected, by using this method we were able to detect 77.5% of cases 1h before the alarm was raised in the existing alarm system, while 23% of cases were detected 4h before the actual alarm. The approach has been tested on real telecommunication network data over the period of one year.","2015-05-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","57-73","","","73","","Decision Support Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\XJ224QD6\S016792361500041X.html","","","Alarm system; Broadband network; Early fault detection; Fault detection delay; Fault management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Lagrangian diagnostic was developed to overcome the pitfalls of traditional Eulerian analysis techniques when applied to cellular flame systems, including the lack of a well-defined measure of “flame progress” and the time-dependent strain and curvature fields that evolve at scales that are faster than the residence time in the flame zone. An integrated measure of consumption along the pathlines was shown to serve as a generalized analog of the Eulerian-computed consumption-based burning speed. The diffusive fuel flux divergence along the pathlines was shown to correlate directly with integrated consumption rate. Insights gained through the Lagrangian diagnostic analysis served as the underpinning of a new procedure to interpret OH-PLIF images from the LSB experiment.

First, GPR on the different facies of a marble quarry in Macael (Almería, Spain) was applied where alternating layers of marble and mica schists can be found. GPR allows for the differentiation of the marble units from the mica schist units, which makes GPR a good tool for indirectly evaluating the reserves in a deposit. In addition, it allows for the detection of the different anisotropies in the marble units (holes, fractures), and this information could be utilised to formulate a work-plan design. Antennae of different frequencies were employed (100, 250 and 800MHz) for these purposes, and the 250MHz antenna had the most effective probing capacity for obtaining an accurate depth resolution. Second, a GPR study was conducted in three types of rock known commercially as Macael Marble, Crema Marfil and Red Travertine before the block-cutting process. For this configuration, the 800MHz antenna was used to differentiate the textures of each type of rock as well as the location of a variety of anisotropies, and the results showed that GPR is an effective tool for evaluating the block quality, determining whether resins must be injected to consolidate the block and estimating the orientation of the cutting process. In the work, the use of a supervised two-dimensional (i.e., radargram) probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA) approach is proposed to highlight only the information from target objects (i.e., marble anisotropy) provided by the radargram, which facilitates the data interpretation by the user. This approach can search activations of the georadar pulse across both dimensions. Once the analysis has been performed, a variable-gain compensation process is proposed to outperform the energy losses that result from the reflections of the signal when a different material is found. The results have shown that the GPR method can be utilised as a tool for the diagnosis of stone materials prior to their use in artistic work or monuments; therefore, GPR may be considered a technique for material selection. The presence of discontinuities (sometimes visible to the naked eye) explain many of the phenomena and typologies of the stone after its eventual alteration, and such discontinuities could be avoided by means of this pre-emptive work.","2015-02-15","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","439-447","","","77","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\4FSYVED4\S0950061814013786.html","","","Discontinuity; Ground-penetrating radar; Macael; Marble quarry; Non-destructive test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Centrifugal microfluidic platforms are an alternative solution to reduce costs and increase the availability of a rapid diagnostic system. The rate of chemical reactions in such devices often depends on the efficiency of the mixing techniques employed in their microfluidic networks. This paper introduces a micromixer that operates by the expansion and contraction of a microballoon to produce a consistent periodical 3D reciprocating flow. We established that microballoons reduced mixing time of 12μl liquids from 170min, for diffusional mixing, to less than 23s. We have also tested the effect of the microballoon mixers on the detection of the dengue virus.

For muscle invasive bladder cancer, surgical removal of the bladder, i.e. radical cystectomy, is in general the definitive treatment which, unfortunately, carries significant morbidities and mortalities. Accurate prediction of the mortality of radical cystectomy is therefore needed. Statistical methods have conventionally been used for this purpose, despite the complex interactions of high-dimensional medical data. Machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for handling high-dimensional data, with increasing application in clinical decision support, e.g. cancer prediction and prognosis. Its ability to reveal the hidden nonlinear interactions and interpretable rules between dependent and independent variables is favorable for constructing models of effective generalization performance. In this paper, seven machine learning methods are utilized to predict the 5-year mortality of radical cystectomy, including back-propagation neural network (BPN), radial basis function (RBFN), extreme learning machine (ELM), regularized ELM (RELM), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) classifier and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), on a clinicopathological dataset of 117 patients of the urology unit of a hospital in Hong Kong.

In this work, we have implemented a diagnostic method to evaluate the SOH of single nickel metal hydride (NiMH) cells, that have an important role in power tools applications. Single NiMH cells of 1.2V and 1.3Ah have been characterized with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique to evaluate the SOH with synthetic methods. Through the study of an equivalent circuit model, we determine that three free parameters synthesize the information contained in an impedance spectrum. A new simplification allows us to construct a diagnostic diagram with only two degree of freedom. A mathematical approach based on the Dempster–Schafer Theory of Evidence has been implemented to interpret the diagnostic diagram. Combining the points obtained by the impedance spectra (IS) at different State of Charge (SOC) and SOH, the Theory of Evidence can improve the estimation of the SOH iteratively, a great advantage compared to the classic Theory of Probability.","2015-03-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","1-9","","","92","","Energy Conversion and Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\CAW5P3L7\S0196890414010796.html","","","Batteries; Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy; Nickel-metal hydride; State of Charge; State of Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an argumentation-based approach to the analysis of clinical discussions, with the aim of providing a multidisciplinary medical team with a support tool that may help discover whether clinical discussions are affected by any weak points, such as contradicting conclusions, invalid reasoning steps, hidden assumptions, or missing evidences. To this end, we have adopted an approach based on argumentation schemes, which provide an intuitive yet well structured representation of general reasoning patterns. Argumentation schemes include one or more premises, a conclusion, and a set of critical questions that challenge the validity of the relation between premises and conclusion. We exploit argumentation schemes to interpret the assertions made by the participants in a meeting and to generate a graph of arguments connected through edges that represent support or attack relations existing among them. The resulting graph is then used to carry out a logical analysis of the discussion, highlighting, for instance, conflicting opinions or suggesting the need for gathering additional information. To show the potential of our approach, we have developed a sample case based on a clinical discussion taken from literature. After having identified a set of argumentation schemes appropriate for the medical domain considered, the case has been analyzed and a detailed logical analysis has been carried out.","2015-01-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","282-289","","","64","","Procedia Computer Science","","Conference on ENTERprise Information Systems/International Conference on Project MANagement/Conference on Health and Social Care Information Systems and Technologies, CENTERIS/ProjMAN / HCist 2015 October 7-9, 2015","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","argumentation; argumentation schemes; Clinical discussion; intelligent support system.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the scale and complexity of today's networks and attacks, alert logs produced by these modern networks are much larger in volume and difficult to analyse. In this research we show that adding post-correlation methods can be used alongside correlation to significantly improve the analysis of alert logs. We proposed a new framework titled A Comprehensive System for Analysing Intrusion Alerts (ACSAnIA). The post-correlation methods include a new prioritisation metric based on anomaly detection and a novel approach to clustering events using correlation knowledge. One of the key benefits of the framework is that it significantly reduces false-positive alerts and it adds contextual information to true-positive alerts. We evaluated the post-correlation methods of ACSAnIA using data from a 2012 cyber range experiment carried out by industrial partners of the British Telecom Security Practice Team. In one scenario, our results show that false-positives were successfully reduced by 97% and in another scenario, 16%. It also showed that clustering correlated alerts aided in attack detection.

Although various machine learning and data mining approaches have been devised to increase diagnostic accuracy, most current methods are inadequate. The recently developed Recursive-Rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm provides a hierarchical, recursive consideration of discrete variables prior to analysis of continuous data, and can generate classification rules that have been trained on the basis of both discrete and continuous attributes. The objective of this study was to extract highly accurate, concise, and interpretable classification rules for diagnosis using the Re-RX algorithm with J48graft, a class for generating a grafted C4.5 decision tree. We used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). Nine research groups provided 10 kinds of highly accurate concrete classification rules for the WBCD. We compared the accuracy and characteristics of the rule set for the WBCD generated using the Re-RX algorithm with J48graft with five rule sets obtained using 10-fold cross validation (CV). We trained the WBCD using the Re-RX algorithm with J48graft and the average classification accuracies of 10 runs of 10-fold CV for the training and test datasets, the number of extracted rules, and the average number of antecedents for the WBCD. Compared with other rule extraction algorithms, the Re-RX algorithm with J48graft resulted in a lower average number of rules for diagnosing breast cancer, which is a substantial advantage. It also provided the lowest average number of antecedents per rule. These features are expected to greatly aid physicians in making accurate and concise diagnoses for patients with breast cancer.","2015-01-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","9-16","","","1","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Breast cancer diagnosis; Rule extraction; Re-RX algorithm; C4.5; J48graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The necessity of using integrative system approaches to understand and solve coastal problems has become obvious in the last decades. Integrated management strategies for social-ecological systems (SESs) call for the development of SES indicators that help (i) to identify and link the states and processes of social, economic and ecological subsystems and (ii) to balance different stakeholder objectives over the long-term within natural limits. Here we use a system dynamics modeling approach called group model building (GMB) as a diagnostic participative tool for understanding the determinants of characteristic SES issues in the Dutch Wadden Sea region and exploring salient SES indicators for management. We used GMB in two separate workshops for two distinct cases: sustainable mussel fisheries and tourism development. Follow-up online questionnaires elicited relevant variables for deriving SES indicators. In both modeling cases participants identified and connected the variables that expressed fundamental SES dynamics driving each issue. In the mussel fisheries model the central part of the structure was the interaction between the model variables ‘extent of mussel habitat with high natural value’, ‘mussel cultivation efficiency’, and ‘market supply’. In the tourism model a key driving force for explaining tourist development was the reciprocal relation between the model variables ‘natural value’, ‘experience value’, and ‘number of tourists’. Application of GMB revealed SES issue complexity and explicitly identified key linkages and potential SES indicators for policy and management in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. As a tool for stakeholder involvement in integrated coastal management the approach enables the joint building of system understanding and the exchange of individual perspectives. Participants agreed with the jointly created models and highly appreciated the way the structured approach facilitated communication and learning about complex and contested issues.","2015-06-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","29-39","","","109","","Ocean & Coastal Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Group model building; Indicators; Integrated coastal management; Social-ecological systems; Wadden Sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Due to the difficulty of making prognoses of prostate cancer, this study proposes a two-stage FNN for prediction.

Then, an integration of the optimization version of an artificial immune network (Opt-aiNET) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to investigate the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Results The evaluation results for three benchmark functions show that the proposed two-stage FNN has better performance than the other algorithms. In addition, model evaluation results indicate that the proposed algorithm really can predict prognoses of prostate cancer more accurately. Conclusions The proposed two-stage FNN is able to learn the relationship between the clinical features and the prognosis of prostate cancer. Once the clinical data are known, the prognosis of prostate cancer patient can be predicted. Furthermore, unlike artificial neural networks, it is much easier to interpret the training results of the proposed network since they are in the form of fuzzy IF–THEN rules.

In particular, it proposes a framework to both, learn the image representation in an unsupervised way and visualize discriminative features supported by the learned model. Materials and methods This paper presents an integrated unsupervised feature learning (UFL) framework for histopathology image analysis that comprises three main stages: (1) local (patch) representation learning using different strategies (sparse autoencoders, reconstruct independent component analysis and topographic independent component analysis (TICA), (2) global (image) representation learning using a bag-of-features representation or a convolutional neural network, and (3) a visual interpretation layer to highlight the most discriminant regions detected by the model. The integrated unsupervised feature learning framework was exhaustively evaluated in a histopathology image dataset for BCC diagnosis. Results The experimental evaluation produced a classification performance of 98.1%, in terms of the area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve, for the proposed framework outperforming by 7% the state-of-the-art discrete cosine transform patch-based representation. Conclusions The proposed UFL-representation-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for BCC detection. Thanks to its visual interpretation layer, the method is able to highlight discriminative tissue regions providing a better diagnosis support.

An optically accessible engine is operated in the RCCI combustion mode using gasoline primary reference fuels (PRF). A well-mixed charge of iso-octane (PRF=100) is created by injecting fuel into the engine cylinder during the intake stroke using a gasoline-type direct injector. Later in the cycle, n-heptane (PRF=0) is delivered through a centrally mounted diesel-type common-rail injector. This injection strategy generates stratification in equivalence ratio, fuel blend, and temperature. The first part of this study uses a high-speed camera to image the injection events and record high-temperature combustion chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescence imaging showed that, at the operating condition studied in the present work, mixtures in the squish region ignite first, and the reaction zone proceeds inward toward the center of the combustion chamber. The second part of this study investigates the charge preparation of the RCCI strategy using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of a fuel tracer under non-reacting conditions to quantify fuel concentration distributions prior to ignition. The fuel-tracer PLIF data show that the combustion event proceeds down gradients in the n-heptane distribution. The third part of the study uses chemical kinetics modeling over a range of mixtures spanning the distributions observed from the fuel-tracer fluorescence imaging to isolate the roles of temperature, equivalence ratio, and PRF number stratification. The simulations predict that PRF number stratification is the dominant factor controlling the ignition location and growth rate of the reaction zone. Equivalence ratio has a smaller, but still significant, influence. Temperature stratification had a negligible influence due to the NTC behavior of the PRF mixtures.","2015-06-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:17","2729-2742","","6","162","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Optical diagnostics; Chemical kinetics modeling; RCCI; Reactivity stratification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The selected techniques belong to two categories: one includes several methods that need reference data for detecting structural modifications due to damage, the second group, including the modified Laplacian operator and the fractal dimension, avoids the knowledge of the undamaged behavior for issuing a damage diagnosis. To explain better the different performances of the methods, the mathematical formulation has been revised in some cases so as to fit into a common framework where the underlying hypotheses are clearly stated. Because the various damage indexes are calculated on ‘exact’ data, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to the number of points where curvature information is available, to the position of damage between adjacent points, to the modes involved in the index computation.

Common difficulties are the limited information regarding the history of the construction, the properties of materials and the morphology of structural members. This paper investigates the capability of advanced numerical modelling to address the aforementioned issues and to simulate the damage in complex masonry structures. The case under study is the church of the Poblet Monastery, one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain. The developed finite element model includes the actual-deformed 3D geometry of a selected bay, aiming to consider the important deformation of the structure during the analysis. Based on the historical survey, the analysis considers different hypotheses to investigate on the possible causes of existing damage: gravitational loading, settlements, past earthquakes and reported structural alterations. The influence of the material parameters on the structural safety is assessed with parametric analysis. Additionally, the parallel use of graphic statics with numerical analysis helps to interpret realistically the structure’s current equilibrium. The applied numerical strategy is effective to understand the causes of the present damage in the structure. The results of the study are useful to make a first diagnosis and are the prelude for future inspection, testing and monitoring activities.","2015-02-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","41-61","","","48","","Engineering Failure Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Continuum damage mechanics; Earthquake; FE deformed model; Graphic statics; Soil settlements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research was aimed at increasing employability via improving the quality of higher and public education. This paper analyses and highlights the relations between a knowledge-rich economy and the quality of higher education with special regard to the preparation of teachers and schools that all serve as a motivating environment for learning. Schools as learning organizations and a model used for diagnosing them The second part of the paper introduces the scientific basis for diagnosing schools. It analyses how the concept of a learning organization developed by Senge can be interpreted and adapted to schools. The applied model integrates three key concepts: the culture and the efficiency of a school organization were investigated with the application of the Competing Values Framework model; the behavioral competences of opinion leaders in schools were tested with a professional HR model (INRO/RDA); schools made SWOT analyses of themselves focusing on their learning capacity. These three concepts/models were integrated in one complex and holistic model, which provided a firm basis for the analyses. Profiles and characteristics of schools as learning organizations The core part of the paper provides a brief overview of the characteristics of the 82 schools based on the complex diagnosis model. This part of the paper describes how the characteristics of schools as learning organizations were formed, and what differences arose among the schools. Based on the fitness of the schools to the LO profile, the paper analyses what kind of differences appear in the CVF model. Conclusions The closing part of the paper summarizes the main conclusions of the diagnosis, and gives suggestions that were articulated for the schools on the basis of the research.","2015-01-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","1494-1502","","","3","","Procedia Manufacturing","","6th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE 2015) and the Affiliated Conferences, AHFE 2015","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","CVF; INRO/RDA; Learning organization; School diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The improvement comes about by considering the finite size of the rolling elements which overcomes the limitations exhibited by previous models caused by the modelling of rolling elements as point masses. For line spall defects, a low frequency event occurs in the measured vibration response when a rolling element enters the defect. Previous models were not able to accurately predict this event without making the simulated and actual defect geometries significantly different. Comparisons between the proposed model, previous models and experimental results are carried out to show that the low and high frequency events are more accurately predicted. This analysis identifies and explains the mechanisms leading to inaccuracy of the previous models. The model developed here can be used to aid in the development of new diagnostic algorithms.","2015-02-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","309-326","","","52-53","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Rolling element bearing; Contact forces; Defect size; Spall; Vibration model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, detecting and characterizing outbreaks quickly and accurately remains an important problem. This paper describes a Bayesian framework that links clinical diagnosis of individuals in a population to epidemiological modeling of disease outbreaks in the population. Computer-based diagnosis of individuals who seek healthcare is used to guide the search for epidemiological models of population disease that explain the pattern of diagnoses well. We applied this framework to develop a system that detects influenza outbreaks from emergency department (ED) reports. The system diagnoses influenza in individuals probabilistically from evidence in ED reports that are extracted using natural language processing. These diagnoses guide the search for epidemiological models of influenza that explain the pattern of diagnoses well. Those epidemiological models with a high posterior probability determine the most likely outbreaks of specific diseases; the models are also used to characterize properties of an outbreak, such as its expected peak day and estimated size. We evaluated the method using both simulated data and data from a real influenza outbreak. The results provide support that the approach can detect and characterize outbreaks early and well enough to be valuable. We describe several extensions to the approach that appear promising.","2015-02-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","15-26","","","53","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Bayesian modeling; Clinical reports; Infectious disease; Outbreak characterization; Outbreak detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, mobile robots are not designed to efficiently manage faulty or unforeseen situations. Even if some research studies exist, there is a lack of a global approach that really integrates dependability and particularly fault tolerance into the mobile robot design. This paper presents an approach that aims to integrate fault tolerance principles into the design of a robot real-time control architecture. A failure mode analysis is firstly conducted to identify and characterize the most relevant faults. Then the fault detection and diagnosis mechanisms are explained. Fault detection is based on dedicated software components scanning faulty behaviors. Diagnosis is based on the residual principle and signature analysis to identify faulty software or hardware components and faulty behaviors. Finally, the recovery mechanism, based on the modality principle, proposes to adapt the robot’s control loop according to the context and current operational functions of the robot. This approach has been applied and implemented in the control architecture of a Pioneer 3DX mobile robot.","2015-06-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","140-155","","","68","","Robotics and Autonomous Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnosis; Mobile robotics; Control architecture; Dependability; Fault tolerance; Recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate hemodynamics and biomechanics quantities which may influence the instability of RAVM and imply clinical complications. Methods A detailed 3D reconstruction of RAVM was obtained from the patient CT scans, aortic inlet flow was measured by color-flow Doppler ultrasound, while material characteristics were adopted from the literature. A numerical finite element analysis (FEA) of the blood flow was performed by solving the governing equations for the viscous incompressible flow. The physical quantities calculated at the systolic and diastolic peak moment were velocity, pressure, shear stress and drag forces. Results We reported a case of a 50-year-old patient with a large RAVM and adjacent renal cyst, who unsuccessfully underwent two attempts of embolization that resulted in the consequent nephrectomy. FEA showed that the cyst had a very low pressure intensity and velocity field (with unstable flow in diastolic peak). For both systolic and diastolic moments, increased values of wall shear stress were found on the places with intensive wall calcification. Unusually high values of drag force which would likely explain the presence of pressure in the cystic formation were found on the infero-medial side where the cyst wall was the thinnest and where the flow streamlines converged. Conclusions FEA showed that the hemodynamics of the cyst-RAVM complex was unstable making it prone to rupture. Clinically established diagnosis of imminent rupture together with unfavorable hemodynamics of the lesion consequently made additional attempts of embolization risky and unsuccessful leading to total nephrectomy.","2015-04-01","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:28","2021-06-05 17:34:18","35-41","","","59","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Modeling; Finite element analysis; Hemodynamics; Instability; Renal arteriovenous malformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
