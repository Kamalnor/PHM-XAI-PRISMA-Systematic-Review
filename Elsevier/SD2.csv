In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system’s use of data, 2) the system’s potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific.","2020-07-01","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:28","101901","","","107","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\QYCLF9C7\S0933365720301330.html","","","AI diagnostics; Bias; Contestability; Explainability; Health data; Organisation of diagnostic labour; Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imaging techniques such as MRI are used to detect anatomical (structural) pathological changes. However, these kinds of changes are usually seen only late in the development. The measurement of functional brain activity by means of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can provide useful information, but its interpretation is more difficult. The scaled sub-profile model principal component analysis (SSM/PCA) was shown to provide more useful information than other statistical techniques. Our objective is to improve the performance further by combining SSM/PCA and prototype-based generalized matrix learning vector quantization (GMLVQ). Methods: We apply a combination of SSM/PCA and GMLVQ as a classifier. In order to demonstrate the combination’s validity, we analyze FDG-PET data of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients collected at three different neuroimaging centers in Europe. We determine the diagnostic performance by performing a ten times repeated ten fold cross validation. Additionally, discriminant visualizations of the data are included. The prototypes and relevance of GMLVQ are transformed back to the original voxel space by exploiting the linearity of SSM/PCA. The resulting prototypes and relevance profiles have then been assessed by three neurologists. Results: One important finding is that discriminative visualization can help to identify disease-related properties as well as differences which are due to center-specific factors. Secondly, the neurologist assessed the interpretability of the method and confirmed that prototypes are similar to known activity profiles of PD patients. Conclusion: We have shown that the presented combination of SSM/PCA and GMLVQ can provide useful means to assess and better understand characteristic differences in FDG-PET data from PD patients and HCs. Based on the assessments by medical experts and the results of our computational analysis we conclude that the first steps towards a diagnostic support system have been taken successfully.","2020-12-01","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:28","105708","","","197","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\VTFZNEK2\S0169260720315418.html; C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\EMUDSCAL\van Veen et al. - 2020 - An application of generalized matrix learning vect.pdf","","","[F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); generalized matrix learning vector quantization (GMLVQ); Parkinson’s disease (PD); Scaled sub-profile scaling model principal component analysis (SSM/PCA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many modern ECG machines provide automated measurements of the QT-interval, these automated QT values are usually correct only for a noise-free normal sinus rhythm, in which the T-wave morphology is well defined. As QT-prolonging drugs often affect the morphology of the T-wave, automated QT measurements taken under these circumstances are easily invalidated. An additional challenge is that the QT-value at risk of TdP varies with heart rate, with the slower the heart rate, the greater the risk of TdP. This paper presents an explainable algorithm that uses an understanding of human visual perception and expert ECG interpretation to automate the detection of QT-prolongation at risk of TdP regardless of heart rate and T-wave morphology. It was tested on a large number of ECGs (n=5050) with variable QT-intervals at varying heart rates, acquired from a clinical trial that assessed the effect of four known QT-prolonging drugs versus placebo on healthy subjects. The algorithm yielded a balanced accuracy of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.99, F1-score of 0.88, ROC (AUC) of 0.98, precision-recall (AUC) of 0.88, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.88. The results indicate that a prolonged ventricular repolarisation area can be a significant risk predictor of TdP, and detection of this is potentially easier and more reliable to automate than measuring the QT-interval distance directly. The proposed algorithm can be visualised using pseudo-colour on the ECG trace, thus intuitively ‘explaining’ how its decision was made, which results of a focus group show may help people to self-monitor QT-prolongation, as well as ensuring clinicians can validate its results.","2021-04-01","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:29","104281","","","131","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\2YFDY82Z\S0010482521000755.html","","","Explainable AI; Automated ECG interpretation; Drug-induced LQTS; Human-like algorithm; Machine perception; QT-Prolongation; Rule-based algorithm; TdP; Torsades de pointes; Visual perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While such healthcare learning models can achieve encouraging results, they seldom incorporate existing expert knowledge into their frameworks and hence prediction accuracy for individual patients can still be improved. However, expert knowledge spans across various websites and multiple databases with heterogeneous representations and hence is difficult to harness for improving learning models. In addition, patients' queries at medical consult websites are often ambiguous in their specified terms and hence the returned responses may not contain the information they seek. To tackle these problems, we first design a knowledge extraction framework that can generate an aggregated dataset to characterize diseases by integrating heterogeneous medical data sources. Then, based on the integrated dataset, we propose an end-to-end deep learning based medical diagnosis system (DL-MDS) to provide disease diagnosis for authorized users. We also provide explanations for the diagnose results. Evaluations on real-world data demonstrate that our proposed system achieves good performance on diseases diagnosis with a diverse set of patients’ queries.","2019-08-01","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:38","2021-06-05 17:52:30","100068","","","13","","Smart Health","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\9PKRG2W6\S2352648318301090.html","","","Deep learning; medical diagnosis; Heterogeneous representation; Knowledge extraction; Query processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
