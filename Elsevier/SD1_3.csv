But also, there is no single instruction or standardization in fault-focused on-line/off-line monitoring applications due to the acceleration of technological developments. Field experts have difficulty in choosing which test and measurement systems should be used in which stage of the complex systems. In this study, the propositional logic-based concept is presented, which field experts can use to manage this process. In this concept, test and measurement systems can be grouped according to the priority-order. According to the results of the graded groups on this concept, the suspected fault is verified by the cause of the occurrence. The applicability of the proposed concept has been tried to be explained by creating possible failure scenarios on the transformer. The theoretically validated concept can be used for even more fault situations. This concept can also be used in another complex systems with a large number of T&M systems where very different fault conditions can occur. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this research was to gain knowledge about the effects of high-amplitude low-frequency structural vibrations (HA-LFV) and audible sound waves (SW) on ultrasonic GW propagation. Measurements were performed on a stiffened panel of a full-scale composite torsion box containing barely visible impact damage. Time-domain analysis of the filtered GW signals revealed that the main effect of HA-LFV was the presence of coherent noise. This was interpreted as the consequence of superposition of multiple dispersive wave groups produced by mode conversion at the moment of reflection on the corrugated panel surfaces during propagation. It was also observed that the coherent noise amplitude depends on the amplitude of the HA-LFV, and on the ratio between the HA-LFV frequency and the ultrasonic excitation frequency. These relationships can potentially be explored for the development of a HA-LFV compensation mechanism to enable in-service GW based damage diagnostics. In contrast, GW signals in the cases with audible SW present were almost unaffected. It was concluded that there is strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that ultrasonic GW propagation with HA-LFV effects can be analysed under the assumption of a permanently corrugated structure.","2020-06-09","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","115289","","","475","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\GN3XMRR4\S0022460X20301206.html","","","Aircraft primary structure; Composite materials; Low-frequency vibration; Structural health monitoring; Ultrasonic guided wave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By recognizing that appearance of boundary vorticity flux (BVF)’s peaks might act as the precursors of flow separation in turbomachines, flow diagnosis based on the boundary vorticity dynamics was then performed. It was shown that the effect of the BVF distribution at the condition in design operating zone is to weaken the axial vorticity component ωz, as well as to enhance the radial and circumferential vorticity components ωr and ωθ. Thus, the peaks of the axial BVF component σz led to the strong weakening of ωz, which is responsible for the flow separations. Geometric optimization for the runner was then achieved by modifying the inlet angle of the blade from 14° to 16°. The optimization successfully suppressed the occurrence of the flow separations and improved the moment on the runner at design operating condition by 4%, which was achieved by the redistribution of the axial BVF component generated by pressure σpz on the pressure side. The fact that only an accurate steady simulation is required for the analysis indicates the great potential application of this method in engineering practice.","2020-06-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","1465-1478","","","153","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\RJEK7Y3R\S0960148120303116.html","","","Boundary vorticity diagnosis; Flow separations; Numerical analysis; Pump-turbine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diagnosis of bone metabolic activity is currently through integrating Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with Sodium Fluoride (18F–NaF) biomarkers. It has been reported that numerous observable pathologies including lumbar fusion, disc abnormalities and scoliosis have often been associated with increased 18F–NaF uptake. The aim of this study was to identify what features of lower lumbar shape most strongly correlate with 18F–NaF uptake. Following a principal component analysis of 23 patients who presented with lumbar pain and underwent 18F–NaF PET-CT, it was revealed that three modes interpreted as (i) sacral tilt, (ii) vertebral disc spacing and (iii) spine size were the three characteristics that described 88.7% of spine shape in our study population. 18F–NaF was described by two modes including 18F–NaF intensity and spatial variation (anterior-inferior to posterior-superior). 18F–NaF was most sensitive to sacral tilt followed by vertebral disc spacing. A predictive model derived from that spine population was able to predict 18F–NaF ‘hot-spot’ locations with 85 ± 5% accuracy and with 71 ± 3% accuracy for the 18F–NaF magnitude. These results suggest that patients reporting with lower lumbar pain and who present with increased sacral tilt profiles and/or reduced disc spacing are good candidates for further 18F–NaF PET-CT imaging, evidenced by the high association between those shape profiles and 18F–NaF uptake.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","103529","","","116","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\AS6G3J6G\S0010482519303889.html","","","Bone metabolic activity; Lower lumbar; Lower lumbar pathology; NaF PET-CT; Principal component analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper an original point of view is given on the IAS measurement by linking IAS variations and shaft vibrations. First the orbit of a rotating shaft is studied to show that it contains useful information about the health state of the bearing. Then angle position sensors traditionally used in IAS measurements are combined to reconstruct this orbit. It is shown that IAS measurements are sensitive to the shaft vibrations, which may be used advantageously to enhance the diagnosis possibilities.

Acoustic signals collected from roller bearings contain information on their health status. Hence, acoustic-based fault diagnosis techniques can provide novel solutions as condition monitoring tools for roller bearings. Traditionally, acoustic fault diagnosis methods have been based on conventional signal processing methods in which prior expert knowledge has been required in order to extract and interpret the health information contained within the collected acoustic signals. As an alternative, deep learning methods can be used to obtain heath information from the collected signals by constructing ‘end-to-end’ models that do not rely on prior knowledge. These approaches have been successfully applied in the condition monitoring of industrial machinery. However, conventional deep learning methods can only learn features from the vertices of input data and thereby ignore the information contained in the relationships (edges) between vertices. In this paper, which combines graph convolution operators, graph coarsening methods, and graph pooling operations; a deep graph convolutional network (DGCN) based on graph theory is applied to deliver acoustic-based fault diagnosis of roller bearings. In the proposed method, the collected acoustic signals are first transformed into graphs with geometric structures. The edge weights represent the similarity between connected vertices, which enriches the input information and hence improves the classification accuracy of the deep learning methods applied. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, experiments with roller bearings of varying condition were carried out in the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate that the DGCN method can be used to detect different kinds and severities of faults in roller bearings by learning from the constructed graphs. The results have been compared to those obtained using other, conventional, deep learning methods applied to the same datasets. These comparative tests demonstrate improved classification accuracy when using the DGCN method.","2020-05-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","107585","","","156","","Measurement","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\RFAZRPDM\S0263224120301226.html","","","Deep learning; Acoustic-based fault diagnosis; Deep graph convolutional network; Graph theory; Roller bearing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on an example of a protected gold flat mirror, we investigated two methods, one analytical and one experimental, for determining the Mueller matrix of a noble metallic mirror. The measured Mueller matrix was shown to be nondepolarizing. Then, using polar decomposition, the measured matrix was interpreted as a combination of a pure retarder and a diattenuator. Further investigation showed that the diattenuation property was very weak, which offered the opportunity of largely balancing the introduced polarization deviation by means of a linear compensating retarder. The results of this work were used successfully for improving the design of a diagnostic device for ophthalmology based on retinal birefringence scanning. The described approach also greatly improves the precision of Mueller-matrix-based computer modeling of polarization sensitive systems.","2020-04-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","164474","","","207","","Optik","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diattenuation; Metallic mirrors; Mueller matrix; Polarization variation; Retardance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies on polygonization of train wheels are based on physical models, mathematical models or simulation systems. Normally, characteristics and mechanisms of wheel polygonization are studied under ideal conditions without considering the impact of the environment. However, in practical use, there are many irregular wear wheels and irregular wear cannot be explained by theoretical models with assumptions of ideal conditions. We look at two possible factors in polygonization: seasonality and proximity to engines. Our analysis of field data shows the environmental factor has more impact on wheel polygonization than the mechanical factor. Based on the Bayesian models, the mean time to failure of the wheels under different operation conditions is conducted. A case study of China’s HSR train wheels is conducted to confirm the finding. The case study shows the degree of polygonal wear is much more severe in summer than other seasons. The finding may give a totally new research perspective on polygonization of train wheels.

Many methods have been developed to identify AF, including both the hand-picked features by experts and the recent emerging artificial intelligent (AI) methods.

However, some common AI methods, especially deep learning methods, do not provide good properties of interpretability, making it difficult to explore the internal relationship between input and prediction results. In addition, most of the reported methods are only for the intra-patient test of AF and Non-AF.

Thermophoresis has been used to evaluate the interaction of biomolecules in solution. In this study, the outer membrane from E. coli was isolated and used to produce OM particles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm. These prepared OM particles were applied in a thermophoretic immunoassay. First, outer membrane (OM) particles with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and anti-LPS antibodies were used as a model to demonstrate proof of concept and the difference in E. coli thermophoresis was explained by the changes in the molecular surface area (A) and effective charge (σeff). The hydrodynamic size of the molecules was measured as a changing parameter, molecular surface area (A), by dynamic laser scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential was measured as a changing parameter of effective charge (σeff) and then evaluated by the Soret equation. Using the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential values, the interaction between the antigen (OM particle with LPS) and antibody (anti-LPS antibodies) could be monitored and the results were fitted to the thermophoretic immunoassay using the Soret coefficient and equation.

Whereas the complexity of the latter originates mainly from the supply and demand of the economic situation, the complexity of the first derives from the lack of heritage data, the high degree of innovation and the uncertainties that are connected to any long-term project. In this paper, the authors apply a cause-effect analysis technique called structural equation modelling (SEM) using partial least squares (PLS) to estimate the costs of an asteroid mining mission concept called KaNaRiA. For data ascertainment, two expert interview rounds have been conducted involving international space engineers and scientists from different professional levels and areas. First, a qualitative method called the Delphi technique is used to identify the main cost drivers and quantify their influence on the overall costs. Second, the cost drivers were formulated as questions to enable the classification on a Likert-scale. The collected data is the input for the development of the cost prognosis model by applying PLS-SEM. The cost model is given and its usage explained. The resulting cost model allows a user-individual estimation of the mission costs depending on the individual judgement of the influence of the final, relevant cost drivers. An application of the model using the judgment of the authors’ is presented.","2020-02-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","440-454","","","167","","Acta Astronautica","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Asteroid mining; In-situ resource utilization; ISRU; Partial least squares; PLS-SEM; Small bodies; Space mission cost estimation; Space resource extraction; Space resource utilization; Structural equation modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, if diagnosed in time, Glaucoma can effectively be slowed down by using adequate treatment; hence, an early diagnosis is of utmost importance. Nonetheless, the conventional approaches to diagnose Glaucoma adopt expensive and bulky equipment that requires qualified experts, making it difficult, costly and time-consuming to diagnose large amounts of people. Consequently, new alternatives to diagnose Glaucoma that suppress these issues should be explored. Methods: This work proposes an interpretable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline that is capable of diagnosing Glaucoma using fundus images and run offline in mobile devices. Several public datasets of fundus images were merged and used to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that perform segmentation and classification tasks. These networks are then used to build a pipeline for Glaucoma assessment that outputs a Glaucoma confidence level and also provides several morphological features and segmentations of relevant structures, resulting in an interpretable Glaucoma diagnosis. To assess the performance of this method in a restricted environment, this pipeline was integrated into a mobile application and time and space complexities were assessed. Results: Considering the test set, the developed pipeline achieved 0.91 and 0.75 of Intersection over Union (IoU) in the optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively. With regards to the classification, an accuracy of 0.87 with a sensitivity of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.93 were attained. Moreover, this pipeline runs on an average Android smartphone in under two seconds. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential that this method can have in the contribution to an early Glaucoma diagnosis. The proposed approach achieved similar or slightly better metrics than the current CAD systems for Glaucoma assessment while running on more restricted devices. This pipeline can, therefore, be used to construct accurate and affordable CAD systems that could enable large Glaucoma screenings, contributing to an earlier diagnose of this condition.","2020-08-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","105341","","","192","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD); Fundus images; Glaucoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major factors in fundus image quality assessment are image artifact, clarity, and field definition. Unfortunately, most of existing quality assessment methods focus on the quality of overall image, without interpretable quality feedback for real-time adjustment. Furthermore, these models are often sensitive to the specific imaging devices, and cannot generalize well under different imaging conditions. This paper presents a new multi-task domain adaptation framework to automatically assess fundus image quality. The proposed framework provides interpretable quality assessment with both quantitative scores and quality visualization for potential real-time image recapture with proper adjustment. In particular, the present approach can detect optic disc and fovea structures as landmarks, to assist the assessment through coarse-to-fine feature encoding. The framework also exploit semi-tied adversarial discriminative domain adaptation to make the model generalizable across different data sources.

The structure of the flame base was measured with combined OH and CH2O planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and the spatial distribution of equivalence ratio was imaged, simultaneously, with CH4 Raman scattering. The velocity field was also measured with particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). Different bulk jet velocities Uj and co-flow velocities Uc were examined. Data show that flames with Uc = 0.6 m/s stabilize much further away from the nozzle than those with Uc = 0.3 m/s and that their structure does not resemble that of the edge-flames found closer to the nozzle. In addition, for Uc = 0.6 m/s, the measured lift-off height decreases with increasing bulk jet velocity, which is opposite to what is typically observed for lifted flames. Statistical examination of CH4 Raman images shows that the flames with Uc = 0.6 m/s propagate through regions of the flow where the equivalence ratio is not always stoichiometric but, instead, spans the whole flammability range. This is not consistent with edge-flames and is, instead, indicative of premixed burning. This is corroborated by PIV results which show that the flame base velocity exceeds that typically reported for edge-flames. Measurements of relevant flow properties were also conducted in non-reacting jets to predict the turbulent burning velocity of these lifted flames burning in a premixed mode. For Uc = 0.6 m/s and relatively large bulk jet velocities (Uj = 10 and 15 m/s), the predicted turbulent burning velocities are sufficiently high to counter the incoming flow of reactants and, in turn, allow flame stabilization. However, for a lower bulk jet velocity of Uj = 5 m/s, the predicted turbulent burning velocity is much less, leading to blow-out. This explains why the lift-off height decreases with increasing jet velocity for methane at 7 bar and Uc = 0.6 m/s. Data also shows that increasing pressure promotes transition from edge-flames to premixed flames due to reduced laminar burning velocity and enhanced mixing.","2020-04-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","323-335","","","214","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","CHO-PLIF; Edge-flame; OH-PLIF; Premixed flame; Raman; Ramanography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work reports on experiments with nominally identical injectors used in different optically accessible combustion chambers, where one of the injectors was designed intentionally to promote cavitation. Optical diagnostic techniques specifically targeted liquid- and vapor-phase penetration, combustion indicators, and sooting behavior over a large range of ambient temperatures—from 850 K to 1100 K. Because the large-orifice injectors employed in this work result in flame lengths that extend well beyond the optical diagnostics’ field-of-view, a novel method using a characteristic volume is proposed for quantitative comparison of soot under such conditions. Further, the viability of extrapolating these measurements downstream is considered. The results reported in this publication explain trends and unique characteristics of the two different injectors over a range of conditions and serve as calibration targets for numerical efforts within the ECN consortium and beyond. Building on agreement for experimental results from different institutions under inert conditions, apparent differences found in combustion indicators and sooting behavior are addressed and explained.

A priority task is to understand the crucial rationale behind diagnosis results of individual patients during stay in ED, which helps prepare for an early transfer to ICU. Most existing prediction studies were based on univariate analysis or multiple logistic regression to provide one-size-fit-all results. However, patient condition varying from case to case may not be accurately examined by such a simplistic judgment. In this study, we present a new decision tool using a mathematical optimization approach aiming to automatically discover rules associating diagnostic features with high-risk outcome (i.e., unplanned transfers) in different deterioration scenarios. We consider four mutually exclusive patient subgroups based on the principal reasons of ED visits: infections, cardiovascular/respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and neurological/other diseases at a suburban teaching hospital.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a combined variable weighting (VW) and separability-oriented subclass discriminant analysis (SSDA) scheme (denoted as VW-SSDA) for fault diagnosis. VW-SSDA utilizes K-means clustering to divide a class into subclasses using a separability oriented criterion, and all fault data are weighted by the corresponding weight vectors before applying FDA optimisation using re-defined scatter matrices.

Methods We proposed a novel patient-similarity-based framework for diagnostic prediction, which is inspired by the structure-mapping theory about analogy reasoning in psychology. Patient similarity is defined as the similarity between two patients’ diagnoses sets rather than a dichotomous (absence/presence of just one disease). The multilabel classification problem is converted to a single-value regression problem by integrating the pairwise patients’ clinical features into a vector and taking the vector as the input and the patient similarity as the output. In contrast to the common k-NN method which only considering the nearest neighbors, we not only utilize similar patients (positive analogy) to generate diagnostic hypotheses, but also utilize dissimilar patients (negative analogy) are used to reject diagnostic hypotheses. Results The patient-similarity-based models perform better than the one-vs-all baseline and traditional k-NN methods. The f-1 score of positive-analogy-based prediction is 0.698, significantly higher than the scores of baselines ranging from 0.368 to 0.661. It increases to 0.703 when the negative analogy method is applied to modify the prediction results of positive analogy. The performance of this method is highly promising for larger datasets.

However, comparatively little effort has been made to investigate SD effects on turbulent non-premixed H2 flames, in spite of the relevance of these flames in safety and their potential application in clean power and propulsion systems. To this end, the impact of SD on turbulent non-premixed H2 combustion is investigated numerically in this work by comparing two three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of temporally evolving turbulent jet flames. In one simulation, a mixture-averaged diffusion (MD) model is used to approximate multicomponent transport, while in the other the MD model is supplemented with a Soret term to consider SD effects. The emphasis is placed on examining and interpreting the impact of SD on flame structure, differential diffusion, and flame-tangential diffusion. It is found that H and OH mass fractions are significantly affected by SD, while SD has a negligible impact on temperature, heat release rate and H2 mass fraction. This is due to the fact that larger SD flux of H radical is strongly coupled with the main chemical reactions. However, for H2 its larger SD flux is located in the fuel-rich zone and decoupled from the main reactions. The difference between a conserved scalar (mixture fraction Z) and a non-conserved scalar (Bilger mixture fraction ZBilger) is employed as a diagnostic parameter to characterize differential diffusion, and the results show that the effects of SD on differential diffusion are reflected in two aspects: (i) increasing the absolute value of Z−ZBilger and (ii) increasing the degree of misalignment between the gradients of Z and ZBilger. Furthermore, the analysis of the contribution of SD to flame-tangential diffusion occurring in mixture fraction isosurfaces indicates that for H radical SD can augment the relative contribution of flame-tangential diffusion, especially in the region of high scalar dissipation rate.

In epicyclic gearboxes, both the carrier rotation and unequal load sharing among planets can lead to abundant sidebands near the meshing frequency. Modulation sidebands due to the carrier rotation have been extensively investigated, while additional sidebands caused by unequal load sharing among planet gears are seldom studied. Aiming at this issue, a phenomenological model of vibration signals of epicyclic gearboxes is developed considering unequal planet load sharing conditions. In this model, an angular shift of a planet gear is assumed to simulate the manufacturing or assembly errors in gearboxes, and different load sharing ratios among planets are calculated. After that, spectral structures of vibration signals of epicyclic gearboxes under unequal load sharing conditions are derived from the phenomenological model. Through the deduced results, it is shown that unequal planet load sharing can influence the spectral structures largely and the formation mechanisms of some additional sidebands in the spectrum are explained. Finally, experiments under three health conditions, i.e., healthy, cracked sun gear and cracked planet gear, are conducted on an epicyclic gearbox test rig. The effectiveness of theoretical deductions of phenomenological models is validated by the collected vibration signals from the test rig.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:38","106414","","","135","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Epicyclic gearbox; Modulation sideband; Phenomenological model; Unequal load sharing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is based on the artificial intelligence technique of genetic programming. By solving a symbolic regression problem, it automatically identifies equation-based models from data. To address possible system complexities, data-based expressions like curves and maps can additionally be employed for the model identification.

Creation of a hybrid-model, combining a base equation with data-based expressions.

Although many researches have been carried out and some research results have been obtained, the overall diagnostic level is not very high. High, which is extremely inconsistent with the status quo that is widely used in production. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out fault diagnosis research on rotating machinery. In this paper, this paper briefly introduces the research and application of intelligent technology in equipment fault diagnosis, and gives the superiority of fuzzy neural network technology application in equipment fault diagnosis, and expounds the basics of fuzzy theory and neural network technology. Based on the principle, the advantages and disadvantages of the two in fault diagnosis are analyzed, and the necessity of combining the two is explained. Based on the previous research on the combination of fuzzy theory and neural network, a new combination method is proposed, and a fuzzy neural network model suitable for fault diagnosis is established. A fuzzy inference method based on fuzzy network is constructed, which realizes the knowledge of information through the extraction, optimization and screening of fuzzy rules. At the same time, the fuzzy neural network learning weights are transformed into case-based reasoning-based diagnostic guidance operators, which play an important role in the rapid extraction of knowledge and improve the diagnostic accuracy. The experimental results show that compared with the commonly used neural network and fuzzy theory fault diagnosis methods, this method can make up for the shortcomings of fuzzy theory and neural network alone.

With the model, generation of contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN) embodied in GUWs, subjected to the key parameters of a “breathing” crack (e.g., crack length), is scrutinized quantitatively.

Objective We determined if the EHR audit log file, a rich source of complex time-stamped data on desktop activities, could be processed to derive primary care provider (PCP) level workflow measures. Methods We analyzed audit log data on 876 PCPs across 17,455 ambulatory care encounters that generated 578,394 time-stamped records. Each individual record represents a user interaction (e.g., point and click) that reflects all or part of a specific activity (e.g., order entry access). No dictionary exists to define how to combine clusters of sequential audit log records to represent identifiable PCP tasks. We determined if PARAFAC2 tensor factorization could: (1) learn to identify audit log record clusters that specifically represent defined PCP tasks; and (2) identify variation in how tasks are completed without the need for ground-truth labels. To interpret the result, we used the following PARAFAC2 factors: a matrix representing the task definitions and a matrix containing the frequency measure of each task for each encounter. Results PARAFAC2 automatically identified 4 clusters of audit log records that represent 4 common clinical encounter tasks: (1) medications’ access, (2) notes’ access, (3) order entry access, and (4) diagnosis modification. PARAFAC2 also identified the most common variants in how PCPs accomplish these tasks. It discovered variation in how the notes’ access task was done, including identification of 9 distinct variants of notes access that explained 77% of the input data variation for notes. The discovered variants mapped to two known workflows for notes’ access and to two distinct PCP user groups who accessed notes by either using the Visit Navigator or the Wrap-Up option. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that EHR audit log data can be rapidly processed to create higher-level constructed features that represent time-stamped PCP tasks.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:39","103312","","","101","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Electronic health records; Workflow analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dedicated experimental setup is designed to induce looseness faults. Two particular phenomena of looseness faults are observed in the experiments under different torsional loads: when the torsional load is low, a constant difference in the rotational speed between the disk and shaft can be observed; when the torsional load is high, the rotational speed of the disk will dissociate with the rotational speed of the shaft and finally fluctuate within a range. The dynamic equations of the disk–shaft system are established, and a novel contact model of rotating part looseness is proposed. In the contact model, looseness contact stress may exist in the contact area and is described as a form with bilinear stiffness. Simulations using the equations are performed to explain the experiment results.

Given a sequence of observations, the diagnosis task generates a set of diagnoses, or candidates, each candidate complying with the observations. What all the approaches in the literature have in common is that a candidate is invariably a set of faulty elements (components, events, or otherwise). In this paper, we consider a posteriori diagnosis of discrete-event systems (DESs), which are described by networks of components that are modeled as communicating automata. The diagnosis problem consists in generating the candidates involved in the trajectories of the DES that conform with a given temporal observation. Oddly, in the literature on diagnosis of DESs, a candidate is still a set of faulty events, despite the temporal dimension of trajectories. In our view, when dealing with critical domains, such as power networks or nuclear plants, set-oriented diagnosis may be less than optimal in explaining the supposedly abnormal behavior of the DES, owing to the lack of any temporal information relevant to faults, along with the inability to discriminate between single and multiple occurrences of the same fault. Embedding temporal information in candidates may be essential for critical-decision making. This is why a temporal-oriented approach is proposed for diagnosis of DESs, where candidates are sequences of faults. This novel perspective comes with the burden of unbounded candidates and infinite collections of candidates, though. To cope with, a notation based on regular expressions on faults is adopted. The diagnosis task is supported by a temporal diagnoser, a flexible data structure that can grow over time based on new observations and domain-dependent scenarios.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","521-530","","","176","","Procedia Computer Science","","Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference KES2020","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","behavioral scenarios; communicating automata; discrete-event systems; incremental techniques; model-based diagnosis; temporal diagnoser; temporal faults; temporal observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though data-driven models have been shown to produce promising results in this context, they generally require labeled examples to fit the models (i.e., supervised learning) and make it difficult to interpret the physical mechanisms. We posit that these shortcomings can be alleviated by studying the physical relationship between damage and the distribution of the resulting acceleration signals, and then choosing an appropriate model to invert this process. To help guide the development of appropriate damage diagnosis algorithms, we first make use of the theoretical formulation of the vehicle-bridge interaction system in the frequency domain and conduct a finite element simulation of this system. From the derived numerical solution, we observe that not only is the trend of the acceleration signals of a passing vehicle with different damage severity non-linear, but also that both the low- and high-frequency responses of a passing vehicle contain information about damage severity. Guided by these observations, we use several dimensionality reduction methods to extract representative features from the vehicle’s vibration response. We then propose an unsupervised damage severity comparison model and a semi-supervised damage severity estimation model aiming at indirect monitoring of bridges.

For this reason, a number of automatic sleep scoring algorithms have recently been implemented. However, their use by physicians remains limited for various reasons: a lack of transparency of the approach used, insufficient heterogeneity among the patients used for testing, or a lack of practicality. This paper presents a system for facilitated sleep scoring that will overcome these limitations. The proposed system, a user-friendly tool based on electrophysiological channels, was trained and tested on large datasets of 300 and 100 distinct recordings from patients with various sleep disorders. The method replicates the manual sleep scoring process, in accordance with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines and generates patient-dependent sleep scoring (using the SATUD system). For an improved level of precision and confidence with regard to scoring, our approach also provides a table that gives indications about the confidence level of the algorithm when scoring sleep. In contrast to recent deep learning approaches, the algorithms used were chosen for their resilience and as they are easy to understand. Medical knowledge was included in the process as much as possible. Results showed that the system is consistent with manual scoring (mean Cohen's Kappa of 0.69 and accuracy rate of 77.8%). It proves that a facilitated interpretation of the model, crucial in such fields as sleep diagnosis, can be provided when using automatic tools. This new system thereby generates sleep scoring decision support tools, which should easily contribute to significant time-saving and help sleep specialists to perform sleep diagnosis.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","100454","","","21","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","Towards a user-friendly sleep staging system for polysomnography part I","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Automatic sleep staging for polysomnography; Decision support system; Patient-dependent sleep scoring using the SATUD system; Respect of AASM Guidelines; User-friendly and interpretable sleep scoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many potential signal processing and analysis techniques that can be utilised to diagnose the machine from the condition monitoring data, however, they seldom incorporate the available healthy historical data of a machine systematically in the fault diagnosis process. Hence, a methodology is proposed in this article which supplements the order-frequency spectral coherence with historical data from a healthy machine to perform automatic fault detection, automatic fault localisation and fault trending. This has the benefit that the order-frequency spectral coherence, a very powerful technique for rotating machine fault diagnosis under varying speed conditions, can be utilised without requiring an expert to interpret the results. In this methodology, an extended version of the improved envelope spectrum is utilised to extract features from the order-frequency spectral coherence, whereafter a probabilistic model is carefully used to calculate a diagnostic metric for automatic fault detection and localisation. The methodology is investigated on numerical gearbox data as well as experimental gearbox data, both acquired under time-varying operating conditions with two probabilistic models, namely a Gaussian model and a kernel density estimator, compared as well. The results indicate the potential of this methodology for performing gearbox fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions.","2020-01-15","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","107038","","","158","","Applied Acoustics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Gearbox diagnostics; Novelty detection; Order-frequency spectral coherence; Time-varying operating conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, often a medical concept (e.g. diagnosis, prescription, symptom) is described in various synonyms across different EHR systems, hindering data integration for signal enhancement and complicating dimensionality reduction for knowledge discovery. Despite existing ontologies and hierarchies, tremendous human effort is needed for curation and maintenance – a process that is both unscalable and susceptible to subjective biases. This paper aims to develop a data-driven approach to automate grouping medical terms into clinically relevant concepts by combining multiple up-to-date data sources in an unbiased manner. Methods We present a novel data-driven grouping approach – multi-view banded spectral clustering (mvBSC) combining summary data from multiple healthcare systems. The proposed method consists of a banding step that leverages the prior knowledge from the existing coding hierarchy, and a combining step that performs spectral clustering on an optimally weighted matrix. Results We apply the proposed method to group ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM codes together by integrating data from two healthcare systems. We show grouping results and hierarchies for 13 representative disease categories. Individual grouping qualities were evaluated using normalized mutual information, adjusted Rand index, and F1-measure, and were found to consistently exhibit great similarity to the existing manual grouping counterpart. The resulting ICD groupings also enjoy comparable interpretability and are well aligned with the current ICD hierarchy. Conclusion The proposed approach, by systematically leveraging multiple data sources, is able to overcome bias while maximizing consensus to achieve generalizability. It has the advantage of being efficient, scalable, and adaptive to the evolving human knowledge reflected in the data, showing a significant step toward automating medical knowledge integration.","2019-12-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","103322","","","100","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Data-driven grouping; Electronic health records (EHR); International Classification of Disease (ICD); Multiple data sources; Spectral clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to develop user-friendly, low-cost and effective facial expression analysis systems for mental health care, this paper presents a novel deep convolution network based emotion analysis framework to support mental state detection and diagnosis. The proposed system is able to process facial images and interpret the temporal evolution of emotions through a new solution in which deep features are extracted from the Fully Connected Layer 6 of the AlexNet, with a standard Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier exploited to obtain the final classification outcome. It is tested against 5 benchmarking databases, including JAFFE, KDEF,CK+, and databases with the images obtained ‘in the wild’ such as FER2013 and AffectNet.

The pathology is a documented cause of fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In clinical practice, diagnosis is confirmed at birth and may only be suspected during pregnancy. Therefore, designing an accurate model for the early and prompt identification of pathology in the antepartum period is crucial in view of pregnancy management. Methods We tested the performance of 15 machine learning techniques in discriminating healthy versus IUGR fetuses. The various models were trained with a set of 12 physiology based heart rate features extracted from a single antepartum CardioTocographic (CTG) recording. The reason for the utilization of time, frequency, and nonlinear indices is based on their standalone documented ability to describe several physiological and pathological fetal conditions. Results We validated our approach on a database of 60 healthy and 60 IUGR fetuses. The machine learning methodology achieving the best performance was Random Forests. Specifically, we obtained a mean classification accuracy of 0.911 [0.860, 0.961 (0.95 confidence interval)] averaged over 10 test sets (10 Fold Cross Validation). Similar results were provided by Classification Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. A features ranking procedure highlighted that nonlinear indices showed the highest capability to discriminate between the considered fetal conditions. Nevertheless, is the combination of features investigating CTG signal in different domains, that contributes to an increase in classification accuracy. Conclusions We provided validation of an accurate artificially intelligence framework for the diagnosis of IUGR condition in the antepartum period. The employed physiology based heart rate features constitute an interpretable link between the machine learning results and the quantitative estimators of fetal wellbeing.","2020-03-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","105015","","","185","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fetal Heart Rate monitoring; Machine learning and statistical models; Multivariate analysis; Physiology-based features; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An accurate and interpretable method is necessary for diagnosing patients with breast cancer for well-performed treatment. Nowadays, a great many of ensemble methods have been widely applied to breast cancer diagnosis, capable of achieving high accuracy, such as Random Forest. However, they are black-box methods which are unable to explain the reasons behind the diagnosis. To surmount this limitation, a rule extraction method named improved Random Forest (RF)-based rule extraction (IRFRE) method is developed to derive accurate and interpretable classification rules from a decision tree ensemble for breast cancer diagnosis. Firstly, numbers of decision tree models are constructed using Random Forest to generate abundant decision rules available. And then a rule extraction approach is devised to detach decision rules from the trained trees. Finally, an improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed to seek for an optimal rule predictor where the constituent rule set is the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. The developed method is evaluated on three breast cancer data sets, i.e., the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WOBC) dataset, and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) breast cancer dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed method can primely explain the black-box methods and outperform several popular single algorithms, ensemble learning methods, and rule extraction methods from the view of accuracy and interpretability. What is more, the proposed method can be popularized to other cancer diagnoses in practice, which provides an option to a more interpretable, more accurate cancer diagnosis process.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:40","105941","","","86","","Applied Soft Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Breast cancer diagnosis; Interpretability; MOEAs; Random forest; Rule extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consolidation is a common term in radiology, which indicates focally increased lung density. When the alveolar structures become filled with pus, fluid, blood cells or protein subsequent to a pulmonary pathological process, it may result in different types of lung opacity in chest radiograph. This study aims at detecting consolidations in chest x-ray radiographs, with a certain precision, using artificial intelligence and especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to assist radiologist for better diagnosis. Methods Medical image datasets usually are relatively small to be used for training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), so transfer learning technique with well-known DCNNs pre-trained with ImageNet dataset are used to improve the accuracy of the models. ImageNet feature space is different from medical images and in the other side, the well-known DCNNs are designed to achieve the best performance on ImageNet. Therefore, they cannot show their best performance on medical images. To overcome this problem, we designed a problem-based architecture which preserves the information of images for detecting consolidation in Pediatric Chest X-ray dataset. We proposed a three-step pre-processing approach to enhance generalization of the models. To demonstrate the correctness of numerical results, an occlusion test is applied to visualize outputs of the model and localize the detected appropriate area. A different dataset as an extra validation is used in order to investigate the generalization of the proposed model. Results The best accuracy to detect consolidation is 94.67% obtained by our problem based architecture for the understudy dataset which outperforms the previous works and the other architectures. Conclusions The designed models can be employed as computer aided diagnosis tools in real practice. We critically discussed the datasets and the previous works based on them and show that without some considerations the results of them may be misleading. We believe, the output of AI should be only interpreted as focal consolidation. The clinical significance of the finding can not be interpreted without integration of clinical data.","2020-03-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","105162","","","185","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Chest X-ray; Consolidation; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Histogram equalization; Histogram matching; Medical imaging; Pediatric pneumonia; Pneumonia; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly the work examines the relationship between profile factor and symmetry on theoretical velocity profiles and how that changes with an increased number of chordal locations. Finally, the benefits of more paths for the purposes of swirl cancellation are reviewed, particularly when axial asymmetry and swirl are present concurrently. It is found that in the presence of axial asymmetry there is a significant performance improvement to be had with an increased number of chordal locations. A relationship between profile factor and error is also apparent. The interpolation polynomial and weight function are used to visualise the quadrature and explain the correlation. The theory that more chordal locations will improve the correlation between error and profile factor is investigated, however initial results suggest this is not true. The theory behind swirl cancellation is explained and the velocity profile diagnostics of common designs in the presence of swirl and axial asymmetry are shown. Examples of how the user can be fooled into thinking all is well in the presence of both axial asymmetry and swirl are also shown. The sensitivity of some designs to swirl is also examined.

Therefore, it is positioned in the network between PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) control centre, more precisely just in front of the PLC. Finally, experimental results are shown in order to explain the internal working procedures in a possible case study.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","11207-11212","","2","53","","IFAC-PapersOnLine","","21th IFAC World Congress","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","filtering; Industrial Control System; Intrusion Detection System; security; Smart Extension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an urgent need for early and reliable screening of COVID-19 patients to provide better and timely patient care and to combat the spread of the disease. In this context, recent studies have reported some key advantages of using routine blood tests for initial screening of COVID-19 patients. In this article, first we present a review of the emerging techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis using routine laboratory and/or clinical data. Then, we propose ERLX which is an ensemble learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from routine blood tests. Method The proposed model uses three well-known diverse classifiers, extra trees, random forest and logistic regression, which have different architectures and learning characteristics at the first level, and then combines their predictions by using a second level extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to achieve a better performance. For data preparation, the proposed methodology employs a KNNImputer algorithm to handle null values in the dataset, isolation forest (iForest) to remove outlier data, and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance data distribution. For model interpretability, features importance are reported by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. Results The proposed model was trained and evaluated by using a publicly available data set from Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, which consisted of 5644 data samples with 559 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ensemble model achieved outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 99.88% [95% CI: 99.6–100], AUC of 99.38% [95% CI: 97.5–100], a sensitivity of 98.72% [95% CI: 94.6–100] and a specificity of 99.99% [95% CI: 99.99–100]. Discussion The proposed model revealed better performance when compared against existing state-of-the-art studies (Banerjee et al., 2020; de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020; de Moraes Batista et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2020) [3,22,56,71] for the same set of features employed by them. As compared to the best performing Bayes Net model (de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020) [22] average accuracy of 95.159%, ERLX achieved an average accuracy of 99.94%. In comparison with AUC of 85% reported by the SVM model (de Moraes Batista et al., 2020) [56], ERLX obtained AUC of 99.77% in addition to improvements in sensitivity, and specificity. As compared with ER-COV model (Soares et al., 2020) [71] average sensitivity of 70.25% and specificity of 85.98%, ERLX model achieved sensitivity of 99.47% and specificity of 99.99%. The ERLX model obtained a considerably higher score as compared with ANN model (Banerjee et al., 2020) [3] in all performance metrics. Therefore, the model presented is robust and can be deployed for reliable early and rapid screening of COVID-19 patients.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","100449","","","21","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","COVID-19; Machine learning; Diagnostic model; Ensemble; Routine blood tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The YLL at diagnosis was highest at the youngest age at diagnosis, steadily decreasing thereafter. For patients diagnosed at age 45 years, the YLL was above 20 for lung and ovarian cancers and below 6 for thyroid cancer in women and melanoma in men. LE progressively increased in patients surviving the first years, decreasing thereafter, to approach that of the general population. YLL in the long run mainly depends on attained age.

Normally the defect-induced impulses will result in harmonics of the fault characteristic frequency and sidebands in the demodulated spectrum. But there will be obvious difference for fault signatures of different bearings with different surroundings, especially the shape of the modulation sidebands. This paper gives an explanation on the causes and influencing factors of bearing fault signatures using an impulse sequence model and a nonlinear multi-body dynamic bearing model in the rotor-bearing-casing system. The frequency components of the load force function on the defect will affect the amplitude of the impulses due to contact loss, becoming the modulation sidebands of the fault characteristic frequency. The extend of the load distribution on rolling elements are controlled by the initial bearing clearance, while the load force function on the defect is given by substituting the estimation of the load force on the bearing and the motion of the defect into the load distribution function. The influence of the defect position and random fluctuations are also analyzed in the simulation, as well as multiple localized defects of the same or different types. The numerical and experimental results show that this modeling and analysis method could be applied to explain and estimate fault signatures of localized bearing faults in a typical rotor-bearing-casing system.","2020-05-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","105449","","","173","","International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault signature; Localized defect; Nonlinear bearing model; Rolling element bearing; Rotor-bearing-casing system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a workflow to build patient-specific CFD models of the LV with moving boundaries based on the Chimera technique to overcome the convergence issues previously encountered by means of the Arbitrarian Lagrangian Eulerian approach. The workflow was tested while investigating whether the torsional motion has an impact on LV fluid dynamics. Starting from 3D cine MRI scans of a healthy volunteer, six cardiac cycles were simulated in three CFD LV models: with no, physiological, and exaggerated torsion. The Chimera technique was robust in handling the impulsive motion of the LV endocardium, allowing to notice cycle-to-cycle variations in every simulated case. Torsion affected slightly velocity, vorticity, WSS. It did not affect energy loss and induced a double-sided effect in terms of residence time: the particles ejected in one beat decreased, whereas the motility of the particles remaining in the LV was affected only in the exaggerated torsion case, indicating that implementation of torsion can be discarded in case of physiological levels. Nonetheless, caution is warranted when interpreting these results given the absence of the mitral valve, the papillary muscles, and the trabeculae. The effects of the mitral valve will be evaluated within an Fluid Structure Interaction simulation framework as further development of the current model.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","103363","","","112","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","Mixed impact of torsion on LV hemodynamics","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","CFD; Chimera technique; Left ventricular torsion; Overset mesh; Particle tracking; Patient-specific; Residence time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach finds widespread use in practice because of its high explanatory power. A more accurate alternative is promised by machine learning, where forecasts incorporate deterioration processes and environmental variables through sensor data. However, machine learning largely functions as a black-box method and its forecasts thus forfeit most of the desired interpretability. As our primary contribution, we propose a structured-effect neural network for predicting the remaining useful life which combines the favorable properties of both approaches: its key innovation is that it offers both a high accountability and the flexibility of deep learning.

Specifically, a generalized distance measure is proposed in conjunction with a novel hierarchical dimension reduction (HDR) approach. It is shown that the HDR can tackle challenges that are frequently observed during distance calculation in big data scenarios, such as norm concentration, redundant dimensions, and a non-invertible correlation matrices. Subsequently, a probabilistic methodology is developed for isolation and detection of faults. Here, Edgeworth expansion based expressions are derived to approximate the density function of the data. The performance of the dimension reduction methodology is demonstrated to be efficient with simulation results involving the use of big data sets. It is shown that HDR is able to explain almost 90% of the total information.

The residuals often exhibit Gaussian properties or can be transformed into a standard Gaussian framework by means of the asymptotic local approach. The effectiveness of the fault diagnosis depends on the model quality, but an increasing number of model parameters also leads to redundancies which, in turn, can distort the fault isolation. This occurs, for example, in structural engineering, where residuals are generated by comparing structural vibrations to the output of digital twins. This article proposes a framework to find the optimal parameter clusters for such problems. It explains how the optimal solution is a compromise, because with an increasing number of clusters, the fault isolation resolution increases, but the detectability in each cluster decreases, and the number of false alarms changes. To assess these factors during the clustering process, criteria for the minimum detectable change and the false-alarm susceptibility are introduced and evaluated in an optimization scheme.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","13727-13732","","2","53","","IFAC-PapersOnLine","","21th IFAC World Congress","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault isolation; over-parametrization; sensitivity matrix; stochastic dynamic system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional multivariate statistical monitoring approaches are based on the assumption that the underlying processes are linear and static and are apt to interpret the normal changes in operating conditions as faults, which would result in high false positive rates. On the other hand, the development of robust diagnostic techniques for the detection of incipient faults remains a challenge for researchers, given the difficulty of finding an appropriate trade-off between a low false positive ratio and early detection of emerging faults. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel adaptive fault detection approach based on the canonical residuals (CR) induced by the combination of canonical variate analysis (CVA) and matrix perturbation theory for the monitoring of dynamic processes where variations in operating conditions are incurred. The canonical residuals are calculated based upon the distinctions between past and future measurements and are able to effectively detect emerging faults while still maintaining a low false positive rate. The effectiveness of the developed diagnostic model for the detection of abnormalities in industrial processes was demonstrated for slow involving faults in case studies of two operational industrial high-pressure pumps.

In this paper, a novel motion compensation approach dealing with Coronary Motion estimation by Patch Analysis in CT data (CoMPACT) is presented. First, the required data for supervised learning is generated by the Coronary Motion Forward Artifact model for CT data (CoMoFACT) which introduces simulated motion to 19 artifact-free clinical CT cases with step-and-shoot acquisition protocol. Second, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to estimate underlying 2D motion vectors from 2.5D image patches based on the coronary artifact appearance. In a phantom study with computer-simulated vessels, CNNs predict the motion direction and the motion magnitude with average test accuracies of 13.37°±1.21° and 0.77 ± 0.09 mm, respectively. On clinical data with simulated motion, average test accuracies of 34.85°±2.09° and 1.86 ± 0.11 mm are achieved, whereby the precision of the motion direction prediction increases with the motion magnitude. The trained CNNs are integrated into an iterative motion compensation pipeline which includes distance-weighted motion vector extrapolation.

Even though no cure exists, an earlier and more adequate choice of treatment could delay its evolution and prevent irreversible sequelae and disability progression. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents an essential nonclinical tool for the detection of a hallmark of the disease, i.e. the presence of demyelinating lesions within cerebral white matter (WM), and, consequently, for the diagnosis of MS early within its course. However, errors in estimating lesions can contribute to a wrong diagnosis, if only the WM lesion load is taken into account, with a more relevant impact in individuals with a reduced lesion load at an initial clinical event, delaying the start of a treatment until a second clinical relapse or after confirming, successively, dissemination of lesions in time. In this context, this work proposes an innovative system, employing a multivariate analysis approach, with the aim of mining and integrating multiple sensitive neuroimaging markers, including but not limited to the WM lesion load, into classification models for supporting a more robust diagnosis of Relapsing-Remitting-MS (RR-MS) already at an initial clinical event. To this aim, a retrospective study of 81 patients with diagnosis of RR-MS (39 males and 42 females, 37.3 ± 8.1 years old, age range 20–58) and 29 healthy people of comparable age and gender (15 males and 14 females, 39.7 ± 11.1 years old, age range 22–57) is used. All the individuals were enrolled at Multiple Sclerosis Centre of the “Federico II” University Hospital (Naples, Italy). A machine learning method based on both statistics and Fuzzy Logic, already validated for its desirable characteristics, is applied to volumetric and relaxometric data extracted from brain MRI by means of a multiparametric relaxometric segmentation method. As results of this work, one- and multi-dimensional models are generated and compared with those obtained with other state-of-the-art methods, confirming their goodness in terms of performance, interpretability and robustness, even if their generalizability is limited by the dependence of measurements on MRI scanner. More in particular, the most promising model is two-dimensional and presents a high value of accuracy (89.1%), a particularly high sensitivity (93.8%) and satisfactory negative predictive value (81.5%) and positive predictive value (91.6%). This model identifies a further imaging marker related to grey matter alterations that, combined to the WM lesion load, allows to discriminate more accurately between RR-MS patients and healthy subjects, perform a more robust detection of RR-MS patients at the disease onset and, contextually, confidently exclude the disease presence in subjects classified as healthy. In addition, due to its interpretability, this model is able to clarify how and how much WM lesion load and grey matter alterations are correlated to RR-MS. Finally, it allows personalized diagnosis support, by calculating reliable classification confidence associated to each particular case.","2019-08-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","101591","","","53","","Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Magnetic resonance imaging; Fuzzy logic; Multivariate analysis; Multiple sclerosis; Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method makes use of the complex relations between variables and the connections between sub-blocks in process decomposition to produce easy-to-interpret sub-blocks related to the process mechanism. Then DISSIM method is applied in each sub-block for distribution monitoring. The multiblock DISSIM strategy can deal with the local behaviors and distribution changes, improving its sensitivity to incipient changes in plant-wide process.

Recent condition monitoring techniques use artificial intelligence in an effort to avoid time-consuming manual analysis and handcrafted feature extraction. Many of these only analyze a single machine and require a large historical data set. In practice, this can be difficult and expensive to collect. However, some industrial condition monitoring applications involve a fleet of similar operating machines. In most of these applications, it is safe to assume healthy conditions for the majority of machines. Deviating machine behavior is then an indicator for a machine fault. This work proposes an unsupervised, generic, anomaly detection framework for fleet-based condition monitoring. It uses generic building blocks and offers three key advantages. First, a historical data set is not required due to online fleet-based comparisons. Second, it allows incorporating domain expertise by user-defined comparison measures. Finally, contrary to most black-box artificial intelligence techniques, easy interpretability allows a domain expert to validate the predictions made by the framework. Two use-cases on an electrical machine fleet demonstrate the applicability of the framework to detect a voltage unbalance by means of electrical and vibration signatures.","2020-05-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","106585","","","139","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Condition monitoring; Clustering; Electrical motors; Fleet monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering that most hospitals use universal models to predict patients’ condition, which cannot meet the individual needs of special ICU patients. Our goal is to create a personalized model for patients to determine the number of hospital stays. Methods: In this study, a new combination of just-in-time learning (JITL) and one-class extreme learning machine (one-class ELM) is proposed to predict the number of days a patient stays in hospital. This combination is shortened as one-class JITL-ELM, where JITL is used to search for personalized cases for a new patient and one-class ELM is used to determine whether the patient can be discharged within 10 days. Results: The experimental results show that the one-class JITL-ELM model has an area under the curve (AUC) index of 0.8510, lift value of 2.1390, precision of 1, and G-mean is 0.7842. Its accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were found as 0.82, 1, and 0.6150, respectively. Moreover, a novel simple mortality risk level estimation system that can determine the mortality rate of a patient by combining LOS and age is proposed. It has an accuracy rate of 66% and the miss rate of only 6.25%. Conclusions: Overall, the one-class JITL-ELM can accurately predict hospitalization days and mortality using early physiological parameters. Moreover, a simple mortality risk level estimation system based on a combination of LOS and age is proposed; the system is simple, highly interpretable, and has strong application value.","2020-04-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","105224","","","186","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Extreme learning machine (ELM); ICU patients; Just in time learning (JITL); Length of stay (LOS); Personalized diagnosis; Two-step principal component analysis (TS-PCA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical variables and radiological image biomarkers (old age, pre-stroke mRS, NIHSS, occlusion location, ASPECTS, among others) have an important role in treatment selection and prognosis. Radiological biomarkers require expert annotation and are subject to inter-observer variability. Recently, Deep Learning has been introduced to reproduce these radiological image biomarkers. Instead of reproducing these biomarkers, in this work, we investigated Deep Learning techniques for building models to directly predict good reperfusion after endovascular treatment (EVT) and good functional outcome using CT angiography images. These models do not require image annotation and are fast to compute. We compare the Deep Learning models to Machine Learning models using traditional radiological image biomarkers. We explored Residual Neural Network (ResNet) architectures, adapted them with Structured Receptive Fields (RFNN) and auto-encoders (AE) for network weight initialization. We further included model visualization techniques to provide insight into the network's decision-making process. We applied the methods on the MR CLEAN Registry dataset with 1301 patients. The Deep Learning models outperformed the models using traditional radiological image biomarkers in three out of four cross-validation folds for functional outcome (average AUC of 0.71) and for all folds for reperfusion (average AUC of 0.65). Model visualization showed that the arteries were relevant features for functional outcome prediction. The best results were obtained for the ResNet models with RFNN. Auto-encoder initialization often improved the results. We concluded that, in our dataset, automated image analysis with Deep Learning methods outperforms radiological image biomarkers for stroke outcome prediction and has the potential to improve treatment selection.","2019-12-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","103516","","","115","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Deep learning; Acute ischemic stroke; Gradient-weighted class activation mapping; Prognostics; Radiological images; ResNet; RFNN; Structured receptive fields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The motion of a VCM is determined by the applied current as well as the mechanical parameters of mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient. VCM motion and mechanical parameters can be determined by a position sensor, but such a sensor may be too bulky for a miniaturized solution. To overcome this limitation, measurements of the VCM electrical impedance versus frequency can be combined with an electromechanical model to identify mechanical parameters. Here we detail an analytical model that relates the electrical impedance to mechanical parameters and demonstrate a miniaturized electrical impedance analyzer for VCMs designed around the AD5933 integrated circuit. The electrical instrument measures impedances of a typical VCM coil of ∼10 Ω with a signal-to-noise ratio of 84.7 dB. We display the effectiveness of the analytical model and impedance analyzer by identifying mechanical parameters of mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient using electrical impedance measurements alone. We experimentally modified the system mass and detected the changes using electrical impedance with a mean error of 5.6% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.95. Repeated measurements of a single VCM configuration demonstrated that the natural frequency, knowledge of which is critical for optimal efficiency, was detected with a variation of 0.2%. A departure from harmonic motion was observed at low velocities. We explain this departure by adding static friction to the model of VCM motion. The AD5933-based miniaturized VCM driver and impedance analyzer coupled with a model that relates mechanical motion to electrical impedance is a viable instrument for in-situ diagnostics and tuning of VCMs.","2019-08-15","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","99-112","","","295","","Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","AD5933; Electrical impedance; Electrical instrumentation; Resonance; Voice coil motor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diverse approaches are used to treat CHF. These approaches, which include physical examination, echocardiography, and laboratory testing, require a high degree of competence to interpret findings and make diagnoses. Moreover, existing methods do not account for the relationships between variables and thus provide limited performance. Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive test, may be used for CHF early diagnosis, which would require further examination to be referred. A previous study revealed a significant correlation between heart failure (HF) and ECG features. However, the method was only performed on small, balanced data; then, the features must be derived from trial and error. The current paper proposes deep-learning techniques—recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures—to create a diagnostic algorithm that achieves high accuracy with limited information and automated feature extraction. The ECG signals used in this study were obtained from the public PhysioNet databases. We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of 24 LSTM models to obtain the best model. Moreover, ECG signal segmentation was compared among the first five and fifteen minutes as features. Out of the 24 LSTM models, the model with the first fifteen minutes of ECG signals (model 1) obtained the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score (99.86%, 99.85%, 99.85%, 99.87%, and 99.86%, respectively). The first fifteen minutes of ECG signals performed well because the LSTM model learned an increasing number of features.

Thermal boundary layer profiles at such sections are seen to be locally perturbed due to flow detachment and its subsequent attachment to the principal wall of the channel. Quantitative data retrieved through the wedge fringe setting interferograms revealed a clear enhancement in heat transfer coefficient for the combination of nanofluids and corrugated channel in comparison with that achieved through water in the plane and/or corrugated channel.

It is of great significance for computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer. Despite the substantial progress achieved by existing methods, several challenges remain, including the lack of fine-grained representations, the interpretability of the reasoning procedure, and the trade-off between true-positive rate and false-positive rate. To tackle these challenges, in this work, we present a novel pulmonary nodule classification framework via attentive and ensemble 3D Dual Path Networks. Specially, we first devise a contextual attention mechanism to model the contextual correlations among adjacent locations, which improves the representativeness of deep features.

Due to system dynamics, bottlenecks shift between different production resources and across production runs. Therefore, it is important to predict where the bottlenecks will shift to and understand the root causes of predicted bottlenecks. Previous research efforts on bottlenecks are limited to only predicting the shifting location of throughput bottlenecks; they do not give any insights into root causes. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a data-driven prognostic algorithm (using the active-period bottleneck analysis theory) to forecast the durations of individual active states of bottleneck machines from machine event-log data from the manufacturing execution system (MES). Forecasting the duration of active states helps explain the root causes of bottlenecks and enables the prescription of specific measures for them. It thus forms a machine-states-based prescriptive approach to bottleneck management. Data from real-world production systems is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The practical implications of these results are that shop-floor production and maintenance teams can be forewarned, before a production run, about bottleneck locations, root causes (in terms of machine states) and any prescribed measures, thus forming a prescriptive approach. This approach will enhance the understanding of bottleneck behaviour in production systems and allow data-driven decision making to manage bottlenecks proactively.","2019-10-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","271-281","","","53","","Journal of Manufacturing Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Predictive analytics; Maintenance; Manufacturing system; Prescriptive approach; Production system; Throughput bottlenecks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A critical component in any computer-aided system, for either detection or diagnosis in digital CXR, is the automatic segmentation of the lung field. One of the main challenges inherent to this task is to include in the segmentation the lung regions overlapped by dense abnormalities, also known as opacities, which can be caused by diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. This specific task is difficult because opacities frequently reach high intensity values which can be incorrectly interpreted by an automatic method as the lung boundary, and as a consequence, this creates a challenge in the segmentation process, because the chances of incomplete segmentations are increased considerably. The purpose of this work is to propose a method for automatic segmentation of lungs in CXR that addresses this problem by reconstructing the lung regions “lost” due to pulmonary abnormalities. Methods The proposed method, which features two deep convolutional neural network models, consists of four steps main steps: (1) image acquisition, (2) initial segmentation, (3) reconstruction and (4) final segmentation. Results The proposed method was experimented on 138 Chest X-ray images from Montgomery County’s Tuberculosis Control Program, and has achieved as best result an average sensitivity of 97.54%, an average specificity of 96.79%, an average accuracy of 96.97%, an average Dice coefficient of 94%, and an average Jaccard index of 88.07%.

Two years of in situ data were collected in an educational building situated in severe cold area in China. Prediction models were established for performance indicators, and results indicate that the average error for COPs, COPu, EERs and EERu were all controlled within 5%. The model established by small amount of data can accurately predict long-term performance, thereby reducing time and difficulty of data collection. RF models, trained with different parameter settings were compared, results indicate that model accuracy was not very sensitive to variables numbers. The impact of input variables on prediction performance was analyzed, and importance ranking changed with period and performance indicators. By comparing the variable importance list, it was possible to establish which parameters were abnormal and lists of different periods can reflect whether the energy structure of building has changed. The overall superiority of RF was verified by comparing with back propagation neural network (BPNN) from robustness, interpretability, and efficiency. First, since GSHP system involving multiple indicators, the robustness, measured by average accuracy, was used to evaluate the accuracy level. According to CV-RMSE, robustness of RF is approximately 3.3% higher than that of BPNN. Second, RF is highly interpretive but BPNN is typical black box model.

Random jumps exist at the change points of the degradation processes. Motivated by this phenomenon, this paper attempts to model such kinds of systems based on the Wiener process. Specifically, In Model 1, a constant change point model is first considered. The analytical results of the system reliability, lifetime distribution, and the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) are obtained. Then, based on Model 1, a random change point model, i.e., Model 2, is proposed to explain the change point phenomenon which is influenced by the accumulative effect of a shock process. Two phase-change patterns (PCPs) are considered in Model 2. For PCP I, the change point is triggered when the number of shocks reaches a predetermined threshold. For PCP II, the change point is triggered when the accumulative shock damage exceeds the corresponding threshold. The system reliability indexes are studied by using analytical and simulation methods. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the approaches and results.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:41","106601","","","193","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Reliability; Change point; Shocks; Two-phase degradation; Wiener process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2012, automatic medical image analysis performance has steadily increased through the use of deep learning models that automatically learn relevant features for specific tasks, instead of designing visual features manually. Nevertheless, providing insights and interpretation of the predictions made by the model is still a challenge. This paper describes a deep learning model able to detect medically interpretable information in relevant images from a volume to classify diabetes-related retinal diseases. Methods: This article presents a new deep learning model, OCT-NET, which is a customized convolutional neural network for processing scans extracted from optical coherence tomography volumes. OCT-NET is applied to the classification of three conditions seen in SD-OCT volumes. Additionally, the proposed model includes a feedback stage that highlights the areas of the scans to support the interpretation of the results.

Uncovering the evolution of phenotypes – how they emerge, evolve and contribute to health outcomes – is essential to define more precise phenotypes and refine the understanding of disease progression. Our objective was to assess the benefits of an unsupervised approach that incorporates time to model diseases as dynamic processes in phenotype discovery. Methods In this study, we applied a constrained non-negative tensor-factorization approach to characterize the complexity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient cohort based on longitudinal EHR data. Through tensor-factorization, we identified a set of phenotypic topics (i.e., subphenotypes) that these patients established over the 10 years prior to the diagnosis of CVD, and showed the progress pattern. For each identified subphenotype, we examined its association with the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes estimated by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Risk Equations, a conventional CVD-risk assessment tool frequently used in clinical practice. Furthermore, we compared the subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) rates among the six most prevalent subphenotypes using survival analysis. Results From a cohort of 12,380 adult CVD individuals with 1068 unique PheCodes, we successfully identified 14 subphenotypes. Through the association analysis with estimated CVD risk for each subtype, we found some phenotypic topics such as Vitamin D deficiency and depression, Urinary infections cannot be explained by the conventional risk factors. Through a survival analysis, we found markedly different risks of subsequent MI following the diagnosis of CVD among the six most prevalent topics (p < 0.0001), indicating these topics may capture clinically meaningful subphenotypes of CVD. Conclusion This study demonstrates the potential benefits of using tensor-decomposition to model diseases as dynamic processes from longitudinal EHR data. Our results suggest that this data-driven approach may potentially help researchers identify complex and chronic disease subphenotypes in precision medicine research.","2019-10-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","103270","","","98","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","Detecting time-evolving phenotypic topics via tensor factorization on electronic health records","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Computational phenotyping; Deep phenotyping; Tensor decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both scenarios yield valuable insights for process analysts and owners, but happen due to different reasons and require a different treatment. Hence a distinction into malign and benign anomalies is required. Existing anomaly detection approaches typically fall short in supporting experts when in need to take this decision. An additional problem are false positives which could result in selecting incorrect countermeasures. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection approach based on association rule mining. It fosters the explanation of anomalies and the estimation of their severity. In addition, the approach is able to deal with process change and flexible executions which potentially lead to false positives. This facilitates to take the appropriate countermeasure for a malign anomaly and to avoid the possible termination of benign process executions. The feasibility and result quality of the approach are shown by a prototypical implementation and by analyzing real life logs with injected artificial anomalies. The explanatory power of the presented approach is evaluated through a controlled experiment with users.","2020-05-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","101438","","","90","","Information Systems","","Advances in Information Systems Engineering Best Papers of CAiSE 2018","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Association rule mining; Process change; Process runtime behavior; Root cause","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, stabilization of a turbulent jet flame is demonstrated in a setup using a pin-to-pin plasma discharge. The coupled plasma-flame structures were visualized utilizing planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of formaldehyde (CH2O) and methylidyne radicals (CH), as well as laser Rayleigh scattering thermometry imaging. The results show that the plasma channel and the flame front are spatially separated by a layer of hot burning products attributed to the flame propagation from the plasma core. Because of this spatial separation, the impacts of plasma on combustion are primarily thermal since the energetic radical species (such as O, H), produced by the discharge, have short equilibration time and cannot spread far away from the discharge channel before reaching the equilibrium state. From this point of view, turbulence would be beneficial for promoting the transport of plasma-produced radicals and thus bridge the gap between the plasma and the flame front. The plasma is still able to stabilize the flame. Based upon the experimental results, a frequent ignition-flame propagation (FIFP) model is proposed to explain the flame stabilization process. For the contracted plasma filament, the local power density is high enough to initialize the flame kernel that propagates away from the plasma channel until extinction. The propagation process is, however, strongly affected by turbulence. Local extinction is highly probable and thus the flame front has to be close to the ignition source at strong turbulence. At such conditions, the stabilized flame can be regarded as a large number of flame pockets, repeating the three phases of ignition, propagation and extinction, which can be summarized as the FIFP model. It infers that the flame propagation phase is important for sustaining the flame to complete combustion. Hence, this phase should be extended, which is more probable to achieve if the plasma ignition pilot is located in a section of limited turbulence.","2019-10-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","79-85","","","208","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Atmospheric-pressure discharge; Laser diagnostics; Plasma assisted combustion; Spatial separation; Turbulent flame stabilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the model is to automate the cost-effective, non-invasive, digital pre-screening of patients at risk for dementia. Towards this purpose, routine care data, which is widely available through Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems is used as a data source. These data embody a rich knowledge and make related medical applications easy to deploy at scale in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the model is trained by using structured and unstructured data from three EMR data sets: diagnosis, prescriptions, and medical notes. Each of these three data sets is used to construct an individual model along with a combined model which is derived by using all three data sets. Human-interpretable data processing and ML techniques are selected in order to facilitate adoption of the proposed model by health care providers from multiple institutions. The results show that the combined model is generalizable across multiple institutions and is able to predict dementia within one year of its onset with an accuracy of nearly 80% despite the fact that it was trained using routine care data. Moreover, the analysis of the models identified important predictors for dementia. Some of these predictors (e.g., age and hypertensive disorders) are already confirmed by the literature while others, especially the ones derived from the unstructured medical notes, require further clinical analysis.","2020-01-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","101771","","","102","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Machine learning; Dementia; Random forest; EMR; Prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient, e.g., for anamnesis, and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in diagnosis or prognosis. However, these systems are widely used, e.g., in diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study, we developed an AI that is able to interact with a patient (virtual doctor) by using a speech recognition and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the patient, which is particularly important for, e.g., rural areas, where the availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population densities. As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks. Moreover, the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI, we further analyzed the acceptance of young people for AI in healthcare to estimate the impact of such a system in the future.","2019-09-01","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","2021-06-05 17:23:42","101706","","","100","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","The virtual doctor","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Diabetes; Diagnostics; E-health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
