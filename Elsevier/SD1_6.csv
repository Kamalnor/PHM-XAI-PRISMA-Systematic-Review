Specifically, high-speed Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) is used to provide spatiotemporally resolved phase information, while high-speed Particle Image and Tracking Velocimetry (PIV/PVT) are used to provide information on the velocity field in both phases. The two techniques are applied simultaneously in a vertical plane through the centreline of the investigated pipe flow, illuminated by a single laser-sheet in a time-resolved manner (at a frequency of 1–2kHz depending on the flow condition). Optical distortions due to the curvature of the (transparent) circular tube test-section are corrected with the use of a graticule (target). The test section where the optical-diagnostic methods are applied is located 244 pipe-diameters downstream of the inlet section, in order to ensure a significant development length. The experimental campaign is explicitly designed to study the long-length development of immiscible liquid–liquid flows by introducing the heavier (aqueous) phase at the top of the channel and above the lighter (oil) phase that is introduced at the bottom, which corresponds to an unstably-stratified “inverted” inlet orientation in the opposite orientation to that in which the phases would naturally separate. The main focus is to evaluate the role of the subsequent interfacial instabilities on the resulting long-length flow patterns and characteristics, also by direct comparison to an existing liquid–liquid flow dataset generated in previous work, downstream of a “normal” inlet orientation in which the oil phase was introduced over the aqueous phase in a conventional stably-stratified inlet orientation. To the best knowledge of the authors this is the first time that detailed spatiotemporally resolved phase and velocity data have been generated by advanced measurement techniques in such experiments, specifically devoted to the study of long-length liquid–liquid flow development. In particular, the change in the inlet orientation imposes a Rayleigh–Taylor instability at the inlet. The effects of this instability are shown to persist along the tube, increasing the propensity for oil droplets to appear below the interface. Generally, the characteristics of the flows generated with the two inlet orientations are found to be comparable, although only six flow regimes are identified here, as opposed to eight for the original “normal” inlet orientation. The unobserved regimes are: (1) three-layer flow, and (2) aqueous-solution dispersion with an aqueous solution film. Furthermore, similar mean axial-velocity profiles are observed in the current study to those reported for the corresponding “normal” inlet orientation liquid–liquid flows. These findings are important to consider when interpreting published data from experiments performed in laboratory environments and attempting to draw conclusions relating to applications in the field. The generated data promote not only a qualitative, but importantly and uniquely, a quantitate understanding of the role of multiple instabilities on the development of these complex interfacial flows, with detailed insight into how the deviations manifest at distances 244 pipe-diameters downstream of the inlet (from high level information such as regime maps, to detailed flow information such as phase and velocity profiles). The data can be used directly for the development and validation of advanced multiphase flow models that require such detailed information.","2017-03-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:19","123-135","","","89","","International Journal of Multiphase Flow","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\JDH93R42\S0301932216301446.html","","","Entrance/inlet effects; Flow regimes; Instability mechanisms; Laser-induced fluorescence; Liquidliquid flow; Particle velocimetry; Rayleigh–Taylor instability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is eyes-closed-awake EEG with dominant or rare alpha rhythm. In this paper, we show that random selection of EEG epochs disregarding the alpha rhythm will lead to bias concerning EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. Methods We compared EEG epochs with more than 30% and with less than 30% alpha rhythm of mild Alzheimer's Disease patients and healthy elderly. We classified epochs as dominant alpha scenario and rare alpha scenario according to alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz) percentage in O1, O2 and Oz channels. Accordingly, we divided the probands into four groups: 17 dominant alpha scenario controls, 15 mild Alzheimer's patients with dominant alpha scenario epochs, 12 rare alpha scenario healthy elderly and 15 mild Alzheimer's Disease patients with rare alpha scenario epochs. We looked for group differences using one-way ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) over normalized energy values (%) on the other four well-known frequency bands (delta, theta, beta and gamma) using two different electrode configurations (parieto-occipital and central). Results After carrying out post-hoc multiple comparisons, for both electrode configurations we found significant differences between mild Alzheimer's patients and healthy elderly on beta- and theta-energy (%) only for the rare alpha scenario. No differences were found for the dominant alpha scenario in any of the five frequency bands. Conclusions This is the first study of Alzheimer's awake-EEG reporting the influence of alpha rhythm on epoch selection, where our results revealed that, contrarily to what was most likely expected, less synchronized EEG epochs (rare alpha scenario) better discriminated mild Alzheimer's than those presenting abundant alpha (dominant alpha scenario). In addition, we find out that epoch selection is a very sensitive issue in qEEG research. Consequently, for Alzheimer's studies dealing with resting state EEG, we propose that epoch selection strategies should always be cautiously designed and thoroughly explained.","2017-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:19","13-22","","","138","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\UP7XWHW3\S0169260716305314.html","","","Alzheimer's disease; Alpha rhythm; Cognitive state; Quantitative EEG; Resting-state EEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this analysis was to demonstrate the use of artificial intelligence based methods such as Bayesian networks to open up opportunities for creation of new knowledge in management of chronic conditions. Materials and methods Hospital level Medicare claims data containing discharge numbers for most common diagnoses were analyzed in a hypothesis-free manner using Bayesian networks learning methodology. Results While many interactions identified between discharge rates of diagnoses using this data set are supported by current medical knowledge, a novel interaction linking asthma and renal failure was discovered. This interaction is non-obvious and had not been looked at by the research and clinical communities in epidemiological or clinical data. A plausible pharmacological explanation of this link is proposed together with a verification of the risk significance by conventional statistical analysis. Conclusion Potential clinical and molecular pathways defining the relationship between commonly used asthma medications and renal disease are discussed. The study underscores the need for further epidemiological research to validate this novel hypothesis. Validation will lead to advancement in clinical treatment of asthma & bronchitis, thereby, improving patient outcomes and leading to long term cost savings. In summary, this study demonstrates that application of advanced artificial intelligence methods in healthcare has the potential to enhance the quality of care by discovering non-obvious, clinically relevant relationships and enabling timely care intervention.","2016-11-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","1-8","","","74","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\J85QI6B4\S0933365716302950.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, taking decision to extend the lifetime of a PEMFC stack based on behavior and remaining useful life predictions is seen as a promising solution to tackle the too short life’s issue of PEMFCs. However, the development of prognostics shows some lacks in the literature. Indeed, performing prognostics requires health indicators that reflect the state of health of stack, while being able to interpret them in an industrial context. It is also important to propose criteria to set its end of life. Moreover, to trust any prognostics’ application, one should be able to evaluate the performance of its algorithms with respect to standards. To help launching a discussion on these subjects among scientific and industrial actors, this paper addresses some of the issues encountered when performing prognostics of a PEMFC stack. After showing the link between prognostics and decision, this paper proposes guidelines to set the limits of a prognostics approach. The definitions of healthy and degraded modes are discussed as well as how to choose the time instant to perform predictions. Then, three criteria based on the power produced by the stack are proposed as indicators of the state of health of the stack. The definition of the end of life of the stack is also discussed before proposing some criteria to assess the performance of any prognostics algorithm on a PEMFC.

The model is motivated by first-principles simulations and optical diagnostics applied to the Sandia n-dodecane experiment. The Lagrangian flamelet equations are combined with full LLNL kinetics (2755 species; 11,173 reactions) to resolve all time and length scales and chemical pathways of the ignition process at engine-relevant pressures and turbulence intensities unattainable using classic DNS. The first-principles value of the flamelet equations is established by a novel chemical explosive mode-diffusion time scale analysis of the fully-coupled chemical and turbulent time scales. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this analysis reveals that the high Damköhler number limit, a key requirement for the validity of the flamelet derivation from the reactive Navier–Stokes equations, applies during the entire ignition process. Corroborating Rayleigh-scattering and formaldehyde PLIF with simultaneous schlieren imaging of mixing and combustion are presented. Our combined analysis establishes a characteristic temporal evolution of the ignition process. First, a localized first-stage ignition event consistently occurs in highest temperature mixture regions. This initiates, owed to the intense scalar dissipation, a turbulent cool flame wave propagating from this ignition spot through the entire flow field. This wave significantly decreases the ignition delay of lower temperature mixture regions in comparison to their homogeneous reference. This explains the experimentally observed formaldehyde formation across the entire spray head prior to high-temperature ignition which consistently occurs first in a broad range of rich mixture regions. There, the combination of first-stage ignition delay, shortened by the cool flame wave, and the subsequent delay until second-stage ignition becomes minimal. A turbulent flame subsequently propagates rapidly through the entire mixture over time scales consistent with experimental observations. We demonstrate that the neglect of turbulence-chemistry-interactions fundamentally fails to capture the key features of this ignition process.","2017-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","2615-2623","","2","36","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\VGCSARH7\S1540748916304126.html","","","Auto-ignition; Optical diagnostics; Flamelet; LLNL kinetics; Turbulence-chemistry-interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model was used to explain the dependencies of instability frequency on burner geometry and other flow parameters, some of which could not be reconciled with previous models. The new model was built upon the Helmholtz analysis of two connected resonators. The instability frequency as well as the complex pressure ratio between two chambers were predicted by solving ordinary differential equations. To assess the assumptions and predictions of the proposed model, the spectra and magnitude of the oscillations of pressure, heat release rate, and velocity were measured for four different operating conditions: rich (R1), lean (L1), stoichiometric (S1), and reduced flow rate (R2) with a kilohertz laser diagnostic system. These measurements reconfirmed that the instability is of Helmholtz type. A global equivalence ratio that is consistently greater than unity was identified to be an enabling factor for combustion instability. This is also in agreement with the predictions made by the proposed model. Furthermore, the model was shown to be able to predict the right trend of instability frequency when multiple parameters were changed. It is concluded that the current model is an improvement over previous models, because the acoustic coupling between different chambers of the burner was considered.","2016-12-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","120-137","","","174","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\WEJJN8EW\S0010218016302334.html","","","Combustion instability; Gas turbine combustion; Partially premixed combustion; Reduced-oder modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the security landscape, exploit diagnosis is always performed by third-party security experts who cannot access the source code. This makes binary-level exploit diagnosis a time-consuming and error-prone process. Despite considerable efforts to defend against exploits, automatic exploit diagnosis remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel insight for detecting memory corruption at the binary level by identifying the misuses of input data and present an exploit diagnosis approach called deExploit. Our approach requires no knowledge of the source code or debugging information. For exploit diagnosis, deExploit is generic in terms of the detection of both control-flow-hijack and data-oriented exploits. In addition, deExploit automatically provides precise information regarding the corruption point, the memory operation that causes the corruption, and the key attack steps used to bypass existing defense mechanisms. We implement deExploit and perform it to diagnose multiple realistic exploits. The results show that deExploit is able to diagnose memory-corruption exploits.","2017-02-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","153-168","","","124","","Journal of Systems and Software","deExploit","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\FQ9MYBX2\S016412121630228X.html","","","Exploit diagnosis; Memory corruption; Reverse engineering; Software vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sitting positions vary between individuals with disabilities who use wheelchairs and individuals without disabilities. In individuals with spinal cord injury, spinal deformities can result in the development of back contours that deviate from the shape of standard rigid back support shells. The purpose of this study was to distinguish and classify various back contours of wheelchair users by utilizing digital anatomic scanning technology in order to inform the future development of back supports that would enhance postural support for those with spinal deformities. The three dimensional (3D) locations of bony landmarks were digitized when participants were in position, using a mechanical wand linked to the FastScantm system commonly used to measure surface contours. Raw FastScantm data were transformed according to bony landmarks. A total of 129 individuals participated in this study. A wide range of back contours were identified and categorized. Although participant characteristics (e.g., gender, diagnosis) were similar amongst the contour groups; no one characteristic explained the contours. Participants who were seated in a forward lean position had a higher amount of pelvic obliquity compared to those seated in an upright position; however, participants’ back contour was not correlated with pelvic obliquity. In conclusion, an array of different back shapes were classified in our cohort through 3D laser scanning technology. The methods and technology applied in this study could be replicated in future studies to categorize ranges of back shapes in larger populations of people with spinal cord injuries. Preliminary evidence indicates that customized postural support may be warranted to optimize positioning and posture when a standard rigid shell does not align with contours of a person's back. To optimize positioning, a range of contoured rigid backrests as well as height and angle adjustability are likely needed.","2016-09-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","999-1007","","9","38","","Medical Engineering & Physics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Asus\Zotero\storage\AQMPUXYU\S135045331630131X.html","","","Assistive technology; Back contour; Back scanning; Back shapes; Back support; Backrest; Pelvic obliquity; Posture; Root mean square error; Seating; Wheelchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Listening test scores (diagnostic rhyme tests, phonemically balanced word tests and phonemically balanced sentence tests) of the four languages were compared under four room acoustic conditions defined by their speech transmission index (STI=0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8). The results obtained indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the word intelligibility scores of languages under all room acoustic conditions, apart from the STI=0.8 condition. English was the most intelligible language under all conditions, and differences with other languages were larger when conditions were poor (maximum difference of 29% at STI=0.2, 33% at STI=0.4 and 14% at STI=0.6). Results also showed that Arabic and Polish were particularly sensitive to background noise, and that Mandarin was significantly more intelligible than those languages at STI=0.4. Consonant-to-vowel ratios and languages’ distinctive features and acoustical properties explained some of the scores obtained. Sentence intelligibility scores confirmed variations between languages, but these variations were statistically significant only at the STI=0.4 condition (sentence tests being less sensitive to very good and very poor room acoustic conditions). Overall, the results indicate that large variations between the speech intelligibility of different languages can occur, especially for spaces that are expected to be challenging in terms of room acoustic conditions. Recommendations solely based on room acoustic parameters (e.g. STI) might then prove to be insufficient for designing a multilingual environment.","2016-12-15","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","79-91","","","114","","Applied Acoustics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnostic rhyme test; Room acoustics; Speech intelligibility; Speech transmission index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. Methods An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). Results For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45%; SD=18.1%; CI=42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85% (SD=42.4%; CI=49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4%. (CI=4.45, 22.35) An N−1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p=0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. Conclusions We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice.","2016-12-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","93-107","","","64","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Interpretation; ECG; Cognitive workload; Computer-human interaction; Decision-making; Segment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for about 90–95% of all diagnosed adult cases of diabetes. Most present diagnostic methods for T2DM are black-box models, which are unable to provide the reasons underlying diagnosis to physicians; therefore, algorithms that can provide further insight are needed. Rule extraction can provide such explanations; however, in the medical setting, extracted rules must be not only highly accurate, but also simple and easy to understand. The Recursive-Rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm is a “white-box” model that provides highly accurate classification. However, due to its recursive nature, it tends to generate more rules than other algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose the use of a rule extraction algorithm, Re-RX with J48graft, combined with sampling selection techniques (sampling Re-RX with J48graft) to achieve highly accurate, concise, and interpretable classification rules for the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset, which comprises 768 samples with two classes (diabetes or non-diabetes) and eight continuous attributes. The use of this algorithm resulted in an average accuracy of 83.83% after 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation. Sampling Re-RX with J48 graft achieved substantially better accuracy and provided a considerably fewer average number of rules and antecedents than the original Re-RX algorithm. These results suggest that sampling Re-RX with J48graft provides more accurate, concise, and interpretable extracted rules than previous algorithms, and is therefore more suitable for medical decision making, including the diagnosis of T2DM.","2016-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","92-104","","","2","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Data mining; Rule extraction; Pima Indian diabetes; Re-RX algorithm; Sampling selection; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments were conducted to study the lean limit, minimum spark energy (MSE), and minimum ignition energy (MIE).

In the field of oncology, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provided funding support to researchers to generate different types of omics data on a common set of biospecimens with accompanying clinical data and has made the data available for the research community to mine. One important application, and the focus of this manuscript, is to build predictive models for prognostic outcomes based on HDOD. To complement prevailing regression-based approaches, we propose to use an object-oriented regression (OOR) methodology to identify exemplars specified by HDOD patterns and to assess their associations with prognostic outcome. Through computing patient’s similarities to these exemplars, the OOR-based predictive model produces a risk estimate using a patient’s HDOD. The primary advantages of OOR are twofold: reducing the penalty of high dimensionality and retaining the interpretability to clinical practitioners. To illustrate its utility, we apply OOR to gene expression data from non-small cell lung cancer patients in TCGA and build a predictive model for prognostic survivorship among stage I patients, i.e., we stratify these patients by their prognostic survival risks beyond histological classifications. Identification of these high-risk patients helps oncologists to develop effective treatment protocols and post-treatment disease management plans. Using the TCGA data, the total sample is divided into training and validation data sets. After building up a predictive model in the training set, we compute risk scores from the predictive model, and validate associations of risk scores with prognostic outcome in the validation data (P-value=0.015).","2016-04-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","431-445","","","60","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Gene expression; Big data; Lung cancer; Clustering analysis; Generalized linear model; High dimensional data; LASSO; Nearest neighbor approach; Penalized regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The detection of the brain malformations is currently performed by visual inspection of MRI images, making the diagnostic process sensible to the operator experience and subjectiveness. The method we propose addresses these problems by automatically reproducing the neuroradiologist’s approach. One-class SVMs are appropriate to cope with heterogeneous brain abnormalities that are considered outliers. The MK framework allows to efficiently combine the different geometric features that can be used to describe brain structures. Moreover, the regularized discriminative direction analysis is exploited to highlight the specific malformative patterns for each patient. We performed two different experiments. Firstly, we tested the proposed method to detect the malformations of the corpus callosum on a 104 subject dataset. Results showed that the proposed pipeline can classify the subjects with an accuracy larger than 90% and that the discriminative direction analysis can highlight a wide range of malformative patterns (e.g., local, diffuse, and complex abnormalities). Secondly, we compared the diagnosis of four neuroradiologists on a dataset of 128 subjects. The diagnosis was performed both in blind condition and using the classifier and the discriminative direction outputs. Results showed that the use of the proposed pipeline as an assisted diagnosis tool improves the inter-subject variability of the diagnosis. Finally, a graphical representation of the discriminative direction analysis was proposed to enhance the interpretability of the results and provide the neuroradiologist with a tool to fully and clearly characterize the patient malformations at single-subject level.","2016-08-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","233-242","","","32","","Medical Image Analysis","A framework for the automatic detection and characterization of brain malformations","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Support vector machines; Computer aided diagnosis; Discriminative direction; Malformation detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sudden degradation was demonstrated for different positive active materials. This work elucidates the cause of sudden degradation in detail. As part of a larger study on nonlinear degradation, in-depth analyses of cells with different residual capacities are performed. Sudden degradation of capacity is found to be triggered by the appearance of lithium plating confined to small characteristic areas, generated by heterogeneous compression. The resulting lithium loss rapidly alters the balancing of the electrodes, thus generating a self-amplifying circle of active material and lithium loss. Changes in impedance and open-circuit voltage are explained by the expansion of degraded patches. Destructive analysis reveals that sudden degradation is caused by the graphite electrode while the positive electrode is found unchanged except for delithiation caused by side reactions on the negative electrode. Our findings illustrate the importance of homogeneous compression of the electrode assembly and carbon electrode formulation. Finally, a quick test to evaluate the vulnerability of cell designs toward sudden degradation is proposed.","2016-02-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","212-223","","","5","","Journal of Energy Storage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Aging; Compression; Cycle life; Graphite; Plating; Post mortem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data mining techniques have proved to be useful for knowledge discovery in this type of data and for supporting decision-making processes. Objectives The overall objective is to classify time series based on the discovery of frequent patterns. These patterns will be discovered in symbolic sequences obtained from the time series data by means of a temporal abstraction process. Methods Firstly, we transform numeric time series into symbolic time sequences, where the symbols aim to represent the relevant domain concepts. These symbols can be defined using either public or expert domain knowledge. Then we apply a symbolic pattern discovery technique to the output symbolic sequences. This technique identifies the subsequences frequently found in a population group. These subsequences (patterns) are representative of population groups. Finally, we employ a classification technique based on the identified patterns in order to classify new individuals. Thanks to the inclusion of domain knowledge, the classification results can be explained using domain terminology. This makes the results easier to interpret for the domain specialist (physician). Results This method has been applied to brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) time series. Preliminary experiments were carried out to analyse several aspects of the method including the best configuration of the pattern discovery technique parameters. We then applied the method to the BAEPs of 83 individuals belonging to four classes (healthy, conductive hearing loss, vestibular schwannoma—brainstem involvement and vestibular schwannoma—8th-nerve involvement). According to the results of the cross-validation, overall accuracy was 99.4%, sensitivity (recall) was 97.6% and specificity was 100% (no false positives). Conclusion The proposed method effectively reduces dimensionality. Additionally, if the symbolic transformation includes the right domain knowledge, the method arguably outputs a data representation that denotes the relevant domain concepts more clearly. The method is capable of finding patterns in BAEPs time series and is very accurate at correctly predicting whether or not new patients have an auditory-related disorder.","2016-06-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","12-30","","","70","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Decision support systems; Auditory brainstem responses; Pattern-based classification; Symbolic pattern discovery; Time series data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stereo particle image velocimetry served to deduce three velocity components and to identify locations of soot based on soot scattering. The measurements complement those of other quantities in the same flames published recently. Flow fields determined for cold and reactive conditions confirm conclusions drawn from application of other laser-based diagnostics: soot is mainly formed in the inner recirculation zone which recirculates reactive, hot unburnt reaction products, and partly transported into the high-velocity in-flow regions. Oxidation air injected after two thirds of the combustor forms a stagnation zone close to the combustor axis and splits into a portion flowing downstream toward the combustor exit and one transported upstream thereby affecting the local gas composition and temperatures in the inner recirculation zone. Analysis of the instantaneous images by proper orthogonal decomposition reveals the existence of a precessing vortex core which impacts the soot distribution. Presence of soot in high-velocity/high strain rate regions where soot formation is unlikely to occur can be explained as a result of transport. Flow field characterization and the correlation with soot presence, in complement of existing data, are expected to provide a valuable contribution to soot model validation.","2017-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","3917-3924","","3","36","","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Soot; Gas turbine; Flow field; Model combustor; Pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SGLPP has two advantages. First, SGLPP can preserve both global and local structures of the data set. Second, SGLPP extracts sparse transformation vectors from the data set. The extracted sparse transformation vectors are able to reveal meaningful correlations between variables, which significantly improves the interpretability of SGLPP. These two advantages make SGLPP well suitable for fault detection and diagnosis in industrial processes. Therefore, a SGLPP-based process monitoring method is developed to improve the interpretability and the fault detection capability of monitoring models and to enhance the fault diagnosis capability. A full SGLPP model is combined with a set of partial SGLPP models to improve the fault sensitivity and to track the propagation of faults between process variables. In addition, three-level contribution plots, i.e., the variable-wise, group-wise, and group-variable-wise contribution plots, are constructed for fault evaluation and fault diagnosis. The effectiveness and advantages of proposed methods are illustrated with an industrial case study. The results indicate that the SGLPP models reveal real process mechanisms and control loops between process variables, and thus produces interpretable monitoring results. Moreover, the SGLPP-based method has better fault detection capability than conventional monitoring methods.

Not accounting for these sources of uncertainty can lead to false-positives or false-negatives in the structural condition assessment. To manage the uncertainty, we propose a robust SHM methodology that combines three technologies. A time series algorithm is trained using “baseline” data to predict the vibration response, compare predictions to actual measurements collected on a potentially damaged structure, and calculate a user-defined damage indicator. The second technology handles the uncertainty present in the problem. An analysis of robustness is performed to propagate this uncertainty through the time series algorithm and obtain the corresponding bounds of variation of the damage indicator. The uncertainty description and robustness analysis are both inspired by the theory of info-gap decision-making. Lastly, an appropriate “size” of the uncertainty space is determined through physical experiments performed in laboratory conditions. Our hypothesis is that examining how the uncertainty space changes throughout time might lead to superior diagnostics of structural damage as compared to only monitoring the damage indicator. This methodology is applied to a portal frame structure to assess if the strategy holds promise for robust SHM.

This paper reports the ease of adoption assessment methods we developed for this track, and the results of evaluating five clinical NLP system submissions. Materials and methods A team of human evaluators performed a series of scripted adoptability test tasks with each of the participating systems. The evaluation team consisted of four “expert evaluators” with training in computer science, and eight “end user evaluators” with mixed backgrounds in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and health informatics. We assessed how easy it is to adopt the submitted systems along the following three dimensions: communication effectiveness (i.e., how effective a system is in communicating its designed objectives to intended audience), effort required to install, and effort required to use. We used a formal software usability testing tool, TURF, to record the evaluators’ interactions with the systems and ‘think-aloud’ data revealing their thought processes when installing and using the systems and when resolving unexpected issues. Results Overall, the ease of adoption ratings that the five systems received are unsatisfactory. Installation of some of the systems proved to be rather difficult, and some systems failed to adequately communicate their designed objectives to intended adopters. Further, the average ratings provided by the end user evaluators on ease of use and ease of interpreting output are −0.35 and −0.53, respectively, indicating that this group of users generally deemed the systems extremely difficult to work with. While the ratings provided by the expert evaluators are higher, 0.6 and 0.45, respectively, these ratings are still low indicating that they also experienced considerable struggles. Discussion The results of the Track 3 evaluation show that the adoptability of the five participating clinical NLP systems has a great margin for improvement. Remedy strategies suggested by the evaluators included (1) more detailed and operation system specific use instructions; (2) provision of more pertinent onscreen feedback for easier diagnosis of problems; (3) including screen walk-throughs in use instructions so users know what to expect and what might have gone wrong; (4) avoiding jargon and acronyms in materials intended for end users; and (5) packaging prerequisites required within software distributions so that prospective adopters of the software do not have to obtain each of the third-party components on their own.","2015-12-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","S189-S196","","","58","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","Ease of adoption of clinical natural language processing software","Supplement: Proceedings of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth Shared-Tasks and Workshop on Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Human–computer interaction; Natural language processing [L01.224.065.580]; Software design [L01.224.900.820]; Software validation [L01.224.900.868]; Usability; User-computer interface [L01.224.900.910]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a new package in R, called ncappc, to perform (i) a NCA and (ii) simulation-based posterior predictive checks (ppc) for a population PK (PopPK) model using NCA metrics. Methods The nca feature of ncappc package estimates the NCA metrics by NCA. The ppc feature of ncappc estimates the NCA metrics from multiple sets of simulated concentration–time data and compares them with those estimated from the observed data. The diagnostic analysis is performed at the population as well as the individual level. The distribution of the simulated population means of each NCA metric is compared with the corresponding observed population mean. The individual level comparison is performed based on the deviation of the mean of any NCA metric based on simulations for an individual from the corresponding NCA metric obtained from the observed data. The ncappc package also reports the normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) of the simulated NCA metrics for each individual and their distribution within a population. Results The ncappc produces two default outputs depending on the type of analysis performed, i.e., NCA and PopPK diagnosis. The PopPK diagnosis feature of ncappc produces 8 sets of graphical outputs to assess the ability of a population model to simulate the concentration–time profile of a drug and thereby evaluate model adequacy. In addition, tabular outputs are generated showing the values of the NCA metrics estimated from the observed and the simulated data, along with the deviation, NPDE, regression parameters used to estimate the elimination rate constant and the related population statistics. Conclusions The ncappc package is a versatile and flexible tool-set written in R that successfully estimates NCA metrics from concentration–time data and produces a comprehensive set of graphical and tabular output to summarize the diagnostic results including the model specific outliers.

While it is true that the level of the turbulent kinetic energy drops to zero as one approaches the wall, the organization of near-wall turbulence does not end at y+≈5. Large-scale structures with significant streamwise extent and spatial organization exist even in the immediate proximity of the wall y+<5. These coherent structures have received less attention so far, but it would be both useful and enlightening to bring them to focus in order, on one hand, to understand them, but also to analyze their interaction with the energetic structures that reside at somewhat higher distances from the wall. We have recently developed a rigorous mathematical and computational framework that can be used for the calculation of the turbulence structure tensors in arbitrary flow configurations. In this work, we use this new framework to compute, for the first time, the structure tensors in a fully-developed turbulent pipe flow. We perform Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at Reynolds number Reb=5300, based on the bulk velocity and the pipe diameter. We demonstrate the diagnostic properties of the structure tensors, by analyzing the DNS results with a focus on the near-wall structure of the turbulence. We develop a new eduction technique, based on the instantaneous values of the structure tensors, for the identification of inactive structures (i.e. large-scale structures without significant turbulent kinetic energy). This leads to the visualization of “vorticity crawlers” and “streak shadows”, large-scale structures with low energy content in the extreme vicinity of the wall. Furthermore, comparison with traditional eduction techniques (such as instantaneous iso-surfaces of turbulent kinetic energy) shows that the structure-based eduction method seamlessly captures the large-scale energetic structures further away from the wall. We then show that the one-point structure tensors reflect the morphology of the inactive structures in the extreme vicinity of the wall and that of the energy-containing large-scale structures further away from the wall. The emerging complete picture of large-scale structures helps explain the near-wall profiles of all the one-point structure tensors and is likely to have an impact in the further development of Structure-Based Models (SBMs) of turbulence.","2016-11-25","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","450-477","","","140","","Computers & Fluids","Analyzing a turbulent pipe flow via the one-point structure tensors","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Active structure; DNS; Inactive structure; Stream vector; Structure tensors; Turbulence structure; Turbulent pipe flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The changes in such vital parameters are highly correlated. They are also patient-centric and can be either recurrent or can fluctuate. The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent method for personalized monitoring and clinical decision support through early estimation of patient-specific vital sign values, and prediction of anomalies using the interrelation among multiple vital signs. Methods In this paper, multi-label classification algorithms are applied in classifier design to forecast these values and related abnormalities. We proposed a completely new approach of patient-specific vital sign prediction system using their correlations. The developed technique can guide healthcare professionals to make accurate clinical decisions. Moreover, our model can support many patients with various clinical conditions concurrently by utilizing the power of cloud computing technology. The developed method also reduces the rate of false predictions in remote monitoring centres. Results In the experimental settings, the statistical features and correlations of six vital signs are formulated as multi-label classification problem. Eight multi-label classification algorithms along with three fundamental machine learning algorithms are used and tested on a public dataset of 85 patients. Different multi-label classification evaluation measures such as Hamming score, F1-micro average, and accuracy are used for interpreting the prediction performance of patient-specific situation classifications. We achieved 90–95% Hamming score values across 24 classifier combinations for 85 different patients used in our experiment. The results are compared with single-label classifiers and without considering the correlations among the vitals. The comparisons show that multi-label method is the best technique for this problem domain. Conclusions The evaluation results reveal that multi-label classification techniques using the correlations among multiple vitals are effective ways for early estimation of future values of those vitals.

NEG-mediated modification of bone’s organic matrix, principally collagen type-I, has been implicated in impairing skeletal physiology and mechanics. Here, we present evidence, from in vitro and in vivo models, and establish a causal relationship between collagen glycation and alterations in bone fracture at multiple length scales. Through atomic force spectroscopy, we established that NEG impairs collagen’s ability to dissipate energy. Mechanical testing of in vitro glycated human bone specimen revealed that AGE accumulation due to NEG dramatically reduces the capacity of organic and mineralized matrix to creep and caused bone to fracture under impact at low levels of strain (3000–5000 μstrain) typically associated with fall. Fracture mechanics tests of NEG modified human cortical bone of varying ages, and their age-matched controls revealed that NEG disrupted microcracking based toughening mechanisms and reduced bone propagation and initiation fracture toughness across all age groups. A comprehensive mechanistic model, based on experimental and modeling data, was developed to explain how NEG and AGEs are causal to, and predictive of bone fragility. Furthermore, fracture mechanics and indentation testing on diabetic mice bones revealed that diabetes mediated NEG severely disrupts bone matrix quality in vivo.

Post injections, small, close-coupled injections of fuel after the main injection, have been shown to reduce UHC in the authors’ previous work. In this work, we analyze optical data from laser-induced fluorescence of both CH2O and OH and use chemical reactor modeling to better understand the mechanism by which post injections reduce UHC emissions. The results indicate that post-injection efficacy, or the extent to which a post injection reduces UHC emissions, is a strong function of the cylinder pressure variation during the post injection. However, the data and analysis indicate that the pressure and temperature rise from the post injection combustion cannot solely explain the UHC reduction measured by both engine-out and optical diagnostics. The fluid-mechanic, thermal, and chemical interaction of the post injection with the main-injection mixture is a key part of UHC reduction; the starting action of the post jet and the subsequent entrainment of surrounding gases are likely both important processes in reducing UHC with a post injection.","2016-08-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","111-123","","","170","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Heavy-duty diesel; Low-temperature combustion; Post injections; Unburned hydrocarbon emissions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to the increasing interest for in-process monitoring tools that allow a fast detection of faults and unnatural process behaviours during the process itself. Nevertheless, the analysis of sensor signals implies several challenges. One major challenge consists of the complexity of signal patterns, which often exhibit a multiscale content, i.e., a superimposition of both stationary and non-stationary fluctuations on different time-frequency levels. Among time-frequency techniques, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a powerful method to decompose any signal into its embedded oscillatory modes in a fully data-driven way, without any ex-ante basis selection. Because of this, it might be used effectively for automated monitoring and diagnosis of manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, it usually yields an over-decomposition, with single oscillation modes that can be split into more than one scale (this effect is also known as “mode mixing”). The literature lacks effective strategies to automatically synthetize the decomposition into a minimal number of physically relevant and interpretable components. This paper proposes a novel approach to achieve a synthetic decomposition of complex signals through the EMD procedure.

Unfortunately, though many pathologies are widespread, there does not exist a unique standardized reference or Gold Standard according to which it is possible to evaluate the patients, mainly when the pathology is in the early stages or is not very noticeable, and the doctor is not sufficiently expert in the problem domain. In this work, we deal with this problem, by envisioning new healthcare services supporting a collaborative clinical analysis of symptoms collected from the patients and forwarded to a group of experts, which are geographically distributed. The experts return back their assessment and diagnosis and the system combines these by means of the Theory of the Evidence, in order to provide a single response. The above services can be easily implemented on top of state-of-the-art distributed computing facilities such as Grids or Clouds, providing a connected environment for medical data distributed over different sites and allowing medical experts to collaborate without being co-located, thereby providing transparent access to data and computing resources. Additionally, such services can provide feedbacks to each expert, in order to improve its own knowledge and experience in the case of divergence between the expert response and the global combined diagnosis in recognizing and classifying the received symptomatic indexes from the patient. We have considered the craniofacial pathologies in infant population as a practical example for better explaining the proposed solution.","2017-02-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","230-241","","","67","","Future Generation Computer Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Collaborative clinical analysis; Fuzzy linguistic sets; Pervasive computing; Prospect theory; Services management; Theory of evidence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such capability is to explain anomalous sensor readings. In our previous conference paper, we built an automated anomaly clarification service, called ClariSense, with the ability to explain sensor anomalies using social network feeds (from Twitter). In this extended work, we present an enhanced anomaly explanation system that augments our base algorithm by considering both (i) the credibility of social feeds and (ii) the spatial locality of detected anomalies. The work is geared specifically for describing small-footprint anomalies, such as vehicular traffic accidents. The original system used information gain to select more informative microblog items to explain physical sensor anomalies. In this paper, we show that significant improvements are achieved in our ability to explain small-footprint anomalies by accounting for information credibility and further discriminating among high-information-gain items according to the size of their spatial footprint. Hence, items that lack sufficient corroboration and items whose spatial footprint in the blogosphere is not specific to the approximate location of the physical anomaly receive less consideration. We briefly demonstrate the workings of such a system by considering a variety of real-world anomalous events, and comparing their causes, as identified by ClariSense+, to ground truth for validation. A more systematic evaluation of this work is done using vehicular traffic anomalies. Specifically, we consider real-time traffic flow feeds shared by the California traffic system. When flow anomalies are detected, our system automatically diagnoses their root cause by correlating the anomaly with feeds on Twitter. For evaluation purposes, the identified cause is then retroactively compared to official traffic and incident reports that we take as ground truth. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically selected explanations and ground-truth data.","2016-12-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","140-155","","","33","","Pervasive and Mobile Computing","ClariSense+","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Sensors; Anomaly detection; Credibility; Information gain; Social data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The human skin is assumed to be subjected to combined radiative, convective, and evaporative heat flux boundary conditions. The study revealed that, the major variation in the thermal response of tumor is attributed to increase in the volume, blood perfusion and thermogenic capacity. The variations due to inter- and intra-patient variability of tumor properties and size are obvious, which could be explained by the retrieved multiple combinations of variables. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface thermal distributions associated with estimated variables are found to be in a good match with the actual maps. The error <10% in the measured thermal distribution tends to give accurate reconstruction.

This “profil cultural” method was designed as a field diagnostic tool to identify the effects of tillage and compaction on soil structure dynamics. It is of great benefit to agronomists seeking to improve crop management and preserve soil structure and fertility. However, the “profil cultural” method was developed and has mainly been used in conventional tillage systems with regular ploughing. As there has been an increase in the use of various forms of reduced, minimum and no-tillage systems in many parts of the world, it is necessary to re-evaluate this method’s ability to describe and interpret soil structure dynamics in no-till or reduced tillage. In these situations, changes in soil structure over time are mainly driven by compaction and by regeneration through natural agents (climatic conditions, root growth and macrofauna), therefore it is important to evaluate the effects of these natural processes on soil structure dynamics. These concerns have led to adaptations and amendments to the initial method based on field observations and experimental work in different cropping systems, soil types and climatic conditions. The description of crack types has been improved and a criterion of biological activity based on the visual examination of clods has been introduced. To test this modified method, a comparison with the initial method was undertaken and its ability to make diagnoses tested in five experiments in France, Brazil and Argentina. The adapted method allowed an improved assessment of the impact of cropping systems on soil functioning when natural processes were integrated into the description.","2017-11-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:20","92-103","","","173","","Soil and Tillage Research","","Visual soil evaluation and soil compaction research","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Biological activity; Bioturbation; Platy soil structure; Soil profile; Soil structure; Soil visual examination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For that purpose a knowledge database was created based on the historical data gathered including data on 109 patients with birth weight less than or equal to 1500g. The core of the database consists of support vector machine and logit regression classification results calculated specifically for that system, and obtained by considering 214 different combinations of 14 risk factors. Based on the results obtained and user demands, the system recommends the best methods and the most suitable parameter subset among those currently available to the user. The program is also able to estimate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity together with their standard deviations. The user is also given information on which additional parameter it is worth adding to his measurement system most and what an increase in prediction efficiency it is expected to trigger. The BPD can be predicted by the system with the accuracy reaching up to 83.25% in the best-case scenario, i.e. higher than for most of the models presented in the literature.

Several signal processing methods are commonly applied in the experimental and real field tests. The generated signals of these tests are quite complex due to the dynamic nature of wear process, i.e., interaction among different wear mechanisms. Therefore, a dynamic model is required to explain the physical phenomena behind the detected signals. However, the current dynamic models in the literature lack to model the dynamic response under wear deterioration process over the whole lifetime, due to the complexity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the evolution of the fault features with respect to the wear evolution process. It utilities a newly developed dynamic model and applies different commonly used signal processing methods to extract the diagnostic features of the whole wear evolution progress. The statistical time domain parameters and spectrum analysis are used in this study. Numerical results illustrate several issues related to wear evolution i.e., capabilities, weaknesses and indicators. The results show the extracted fault features and how they change with respect to the wear evolution process i.e., how the topological and tribological changes influence the extracted defect features. In this sense, the study helps to justify the experimental results in literature.

A great advantage of the decision tree is that it can be understood and interpreted and therefore its reliability in fault diagnosis can be validated by both testing data and expert knowledge. A steady-state detector and a regression model are incorporated into the strategy to increase the interpretability of the diagnostic strategy developed. The proposed strategy is validated using the data from ASHRAE 1312-RP. It is shown that this strategy can achieve a good diagnostic performance with an average F-measure of 0.97. The interpretation of the diagnostic decision tree using expert knowledge showed that some diagnostic rules generated in the decision tree comply with expert knowledge.

With this aim we have applied thermographic particle image velocimetry (thermographic PIV) to investigate the flow emanating from angled and trenched cooling holes in a closed-loop optically-accessible wind tunnel facility. BAM:Eu2+ thermographic phosphor particles were seeded into the flow as a tracer. A pulsed high-speed UV laser was used to excite the particles and the luminescence was detected using two high-speed cameras to determine the temperature field by a two-colour ratiometric approach. The velocity field was measured using ordinary high-speed PIV. The simultaneously measured fields were sampled at a rate of 6kHz in a vertical plane through the centreline of the symmetrical single-row cooling holes. The flowrate and temperature of the cooling air and heated main flow were chosen to achieve density and momentum flux ratios of 1.6 and 8 respectively. For these conditions the average and RMS temperature fields show that for ordinary angled holes the jet is detached from the surface. In contrast, the trenched geometry leads to a cooling film attached to the surface. However, time-resolved image sequences show instances where hot air breaks through the cooling film and almost reaches the surface. Similar image sequences for the angled holes show that the detached coolant jet becomes unstable downstream and pockets of cold air are ejected into the main flow. This intermittency may in part explain the observation that the measured turbulent heat flux is oriented towards the cold core, but deviates from the direction of the mean temperature gradient, thereby contradicting the simple gradient diffusion hypothesis commonly used in RANS simulations.","2016-12-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:21","390-400","","","103","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","High-speed laser diagnostics; Flow temperature imaging; Gas turbine film cooling; Thermographic phosphors; Thermographic PIV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, there is interest among intelligent-lighting platform developers to offer predictive maintenance capabilities to users. The existing useful life prediction model defines LED lifetime based on parametric failure; however, there is a need for a useful life prediction model based on catastrophic failure, which can occur with the degradation of components in an LED package. Electrical parameters, especially package series resistance, are good indicators of LED package health (i.e., remaining useful life) and could potentially be sensed real-time in an application. In this study, the series resistance variation pattern until catastrophic failure was measured at different current and temperature stress conditions. The degradation mechanisms at each phase of variation were explained and, using available models, activation energies and exponents were extracted. The experimental data suggest electromigration-induced metal migration from the contact metallization layer to the semiconductor is the cause of short circuit catastrophic failure of LED packages. The variation patterns of ideality factor and reverse leakage current support this hypothesis.

Two well-known methods for selecting the demodulation band are the Fast Kurtogram, based on the kurtosis of the filtered time signal, and the Protrugram, which uses the kurtosis of the envelope (amplitude) spectrum. Although these two methods have been successfully applied in many cases, the authors have observed that they may fail in specific environments, such as in the presence of electromagnetic interference (EMI) or other impulsive masking signals. In this paper, a simple spectral kurtosis-based approach is proposed for selecting the best demodulation band to extract bearing fault-related impulsive content from vibration signals contaminated with strong EMI. The method is applied to vibration signals obtained from a planetary gearbox test rig with planet bearings seeded with inner and outer race faults. Results from the Fast Kurtogram and Protrugram methods are also included for comparison. The proposed approach is found to exhibit superior diagnostic performance in the presence of intense EMI. Another contribution of the paper is to introduce and explain the issue of EMI to the condition monitoring community. The paper outlines the characteristics of EMI arising from widely-used variable frequency drives, and these characteristics are used to simulate an EMI-contaminated vibration signal to further test the performance of the proposed approach. Although EMI has been acknowledged as a serious problem in many industrial cases, there have been very few studies showing its adverse effects on machine diagnostics. It is important for analysts to be able to identify EMI in measured vibration signals, lest it interfere with the analysis undertaken.","2016-06-15","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:21","371-394","","","75","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Rolling element bearing; Bearing diagnostics; Demodulation band; Electromagnetic interference; Envelope analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research indicates that these reviews influence consumers' shopping attitudes and behaviors, questions remain about how consumers evaluate the product reviews themselves. With the current research, we introduce a new methodology for identifying the review factors that shoppers use to evaluate review helpfulness, and we integrate prior literature to provide a framework that explains how these factors reflect readers' general concerns about the diagnosticity (uncertainty and equivocality) and credibility (trust and expertise) of electronic word-of-mouth. Based on this framework, we offer predictions about how the relative importance of diagnosticity and credibility should vary systematically across search and experience product types. By analyzing secondary data consisting of over 8000 helpfulness ratings from product reviews posted by shoppers on Amazon.com, we find that, while review content affects helpfulness in complex ways, these effects are well explained by the proposed framework. Interestingly, the data suggest that review writers who explicitly attempt to enhance review diagnosticity or credibility are often ineffective or systematically unhelpful. Our findings have implications for both IS developers and retailers for designing online decision support systems to optimize communication practices and better manage consumer-generated content and interactions among consumers.","2015-11-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:21","12-23","","","79","","Decision Support Systems","Can online product reviews be more helpful?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Helpfulness; Information equivocality; Information uncertainty; Product review; Search-experience goods; Word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess its accuracy and interpretability, these models are compared to methodologies previously proposed in this domain: Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models and logistic regression models. The methods are tested using a retrospective cohort study including ICU patients with abdominal septic shock. Regarding accuracy, PFS models are comparable to fuzzy modeling and logistic regression. In terms of interpretability, results indicate that PFS models increase the transparency of the learned system (using fuzzy rules), but at the same time, provide additional means for validating the fuzzy classifier using expert knowledge (from physicians in this paper).

While these tools have the potential to greatly improve the quality of patient care, the effective utilization of their techniques within clinical practice may encounter two significant challenges. First, the increasing amount of electronic data generated by clinical processes can impose scalability challenges for current computational tools, requiring parallel or distributed implementations of such tools to scale. Secondly, as technology becomes increasingly intertwined in clinical workflows these tools must not only operate efficiently, but also in an interpretable manner. Failure to identity areas of uncertainty or provide appropriate context creates a potentially complex situation for both physicians and patients. This paper will present a case study investigating the issues associated with first scaling a disease prediction algorithm to accommodate dataset sizes expected in large medical practices.

They are routinely applied for imaging in the IR and visible spectral regions. One of the main technical difficulties in interpreting the data of camera based diagnostics is the presence of movements of the field of view. Small movements occur due to machine shaking during normal pulses while large ones may arise during disruptions. Some cameras show a correlation of image movement with change of magnetic field strength. For deriving unaltered information from the videos and for allowing correct interpretation an image registration method, based on highly distinctive scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors and on the coherent point drift (CPD) points set registration technique, has been developed. The algorithm incorporates a complex procedure for rejecting outliers. The method has been applied for vibrations correction to videos collected by the JET wide angle infrared camera and for the correction of spurious rotations in the case of the JET fast visible camera (which is equipped with an image intensifier). The method has proved to be able to deal with the images provided by this camera frequently characterized by low contrast and a high level of blurring and noise.","2015-10-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:21","765-768","","","96-97","","Fusion Engineering and Design","","Proceedings of the 28th Symposium On Fusion Technology (SOFT-28)","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Image registration; SIFT descriptors; Tokamak neutron and gamma plasma diagnostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional clinical decision support systems are based on individual classifiers or a simple combination of these classifiers which tend to show moderate performance. In this research, a multi-layer classifier ensemble framework is proposed based on the optimal combination of heterogeneous classifiers. The proposed model named “HMV” overcomes the limitations of conventional performance bottlenecks by utilizing an ensemble of seven heterogeneous classifiers. The framework is evaluated on two different heart disease datasets, two breast cancer datasets, two diabetes datasets, two liver disease datasets, one Parkinson's disease dataset and one hepatitis dataset obtained from public repositories. Effectiveness of the proposed ensemble is investigated by comparison of results with several well-known classifiers as well as ensemble techniques.

This study investigates SPI through the application of knowledge management (KM) at the software project level, viewing KM, when applied in software development, as complementary to SPI. Objective This study advances the use of KM in SPI by investigating impediments to the use and flow of knowledge within an individual software development project. Our proposition is that the removal of obstacles to project-level knowledge flow (K-flow) will enhance SPI. We investigate this proposition by exploring the problems associated with project K-flows as seen by software project team members. Method We conducted a descriptive case study of an industrial software development project, in which we collected data concerning project knowledge sources and K-flows using semi-structured interviews. Using this data, we constructed a diagnostic project knowledge map (K-map). The K-map was analyzed to identify K-flow obstacles and potential solutions. Questionnaires based on these obstacles and solutions were formulated to probe software engineers’ perceptions of the effect of the solutions on SPI. Results Findings from participant questionnaires reveal that software engineers perceive that the removal or mitigation of project-level K-flow obstacles generally reduces the time to perform their work, helps them to meet their deadlines, and improves their work quality, thus resulting in SPI. Conclusions This study provides support for the usefulness of project-level K-flow obstacle removal for SPI. It provides a unique project-level perspective, using input from the project's software engineers. It also explains and supports the use of K-mapping for the identification of project-level K-flow obstacles. With this approach, practitioners gain insight into SPI in “real time” as a project is executed. These insights may help to enhance their current and future SPI efforts.","2016-04-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:21","151-170","","","72","","Information and Software Technology","Could removal of project-level knowledge flow obstacles contribute to software process improvement?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Knowledge flow (K-flow); Knowledge management; Software engineering; Software process; Software process improvement; SPI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper shows how to achieve this. There are two central ideas. The first idea is to organize the robot's knowledge into three layers: instance knowledge at the bottom, commonsense knowledge above that, and diagnostic knowledge on top. Knowledge in a layer above can be used to modify knowledge in the layer(s) below. The second idea is that the robot should represent not just how its actions change the world, but also what it knows or believes. There are two types of knowledge effects the robot's actions can have: epistemic effects (I believe X because I saw it) and assumptions (I'll assume X to be true). By combining the knowledge layers with the models of knowledge effects, we can simultaneously solve several problems in robotics: (i) task planning and execution under uncertainty; (ii) task planning and execution in open worlds; (iii) explaining task failure; (iv) verifying those explanations.

The developed method comprises two main stages: (i) preprocessing to enhance image details and (ii) supervised training for learning both the features and the breast imaging lesions classifier. In contrast to previous works, we adopt a hybrid approach where convolutional neural networks are used to learn the representation in a supervised way instead of designing particular descriptors to explain the content of mammography images. Results Experimental results using the developed benchmarking breast cancer dataset demonstrated that our method exhibits significant improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art image descriptors, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and histogram of the gradient divergence (HGD), increasing the performance from 0.787 to 0.822 in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Interestingly, this model also outperforms a set of hand-crafted features that take advantage of additional information from segmentation by the radiologist. Finally, the combination of both representations, learned and hand-crafted, resulted in the best descriptor for mass lesion classification, obtaining 0.826 in the AUC score. Conclusions A novel deep learning based framework to automatically address classification of breast mass lesions in mammography was developed.","2016-04-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","248-257","","","127","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Convolutional neural networks; Breast cancer; Computer-aided diagnosis; Feature learning; Mammography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sooting structures and relative PAH concentrations were measured with laser diagnostics. Detailed soot modeling using recently developed PAH chemistry and surface reaction mechanism was performed and the results were compared with experimental data for ethylene flames, focusing on the effects of strain rates. The results showed that increase in strain rate reduced soot volume fraction, average size and peak number density. Increase in oxygen mole fraction increased soot loading and decreased its sensitivity on strain rate. The soot volume fractions of ethane, propene and propane flames were also measured as a function of global strain rate. The sensitivity of soot volume fraction to strain rate was observed to be fuel dependent at a fixed oxygen mole fraction, with the sensitivity being higher for more sooting fuels. However, when the soot loadings were matched at a reference strain rate for different fuels by adjusting oxygen mole fraction, the dependence of soot loading on strain rate became comparable among the tested fuels. PAH concentrations were shown to decrease with increase in strain rate and the dependence on strain rate is more pronounced for larger PAHs. Soot modeling was performed using detailed PAH growth chemistry with molecular growth up to coronene. A qualitative agreement was obtained between experimental and simulation results, which was then used to explain the experimentally observed strain rate effect on soot growth. However, quantitatively, the simulation result exhibits higher sensitivity to strain rate, especially for large PAHs and soot volume fractions.","2016-03-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","433-444","","","165","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","PAH; Counterflow diffusion flame; Soot formation; Strain rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their failures may cause transmission system breakdown and result in economic loss. Identification of different gear crack levels is important to prevent any unexpected gear failure because gear cracks lead to gear tooth breakage. Signal processing based methods mainly require expertize to explain gear fault signatures which is usually not easy to be achieved by ordinary users. In order to automatically identify different gear crack levels, intelligent gear crack identification methods should be developed. The previous case studies experimentally proved that K-nearest neighbors based methods exhibit high prediction accuracies for identification of 3 different gear crack levels under different motor speeds and loads. In this short communication, to further enhance prediction accuracies of existing K-nearest neighbors based methods and extend identification of 3 different gear crack levels to identification of 5 different gear crack levels, redundant statistical features are constructed by using Daubechies 44 (db44) binary wavelet packet transform at different wavelet decomposition levels, prior to the use of a K-nearest neighbors method. The dimensionality of redundant statistical features is 620, which provides richer gear fault signatures. Since many of these statistical features are redundant and highly correlated with each other, dimensionality reduction of redundant statistical features is conducted to obtain new significant statistical features. At last, the K-nearest neighbors method is used to identify 5 different gear crack levels under different motor speeds and loads. A case study including 3 experiments is investigated to demonstrate that the developed method provides higher prediction accuracies than the existing K-nearest neighbors based methods for recognizing different gear crack levels under different motor speeds and loads. Based on the new significant statistical features, some other popular statistical models including linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, classification and regression tree and naive Bayes classifier, are compared with the developed method. The results show that the developed method has the highest prediction accuracies among these statistical models. Additionally, selection of the number of new significant features and parameter selection of K-nearest neighbors are thoroughly investigated.","2016-03-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","201-208","","","70-71","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","K-nearest neighbors based methods for identification of different gear crack levels under different motor speeds and loads","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Fault diagnosis; Dimensionality reduction; -nearest neighbors; Gear crack; Redundant statistical features","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of efficient and interpretable anomaly detection systems is fundamental to keeping production costs low. As the dimension of process monitoring data can become extremely high anomaly detection systems are impacted by the curse of dimensionality, hence dimensionality reduction plays an important role. Classical dimensionality reduction approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis, generally involve transformations that seek to maximize the explained variance. In datasets with several clusters of correlated variables the contributions of isolated variables to explained variance may be insignificant, with the result that they may not be included in the reduced data representation. It is then not possible to detect an anomaly if it is only reflected in such isolated variables.

In addition, hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver, can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even liver cancer. Numerous methods for diagnosing liver disease have been applied, but most current diagnostic methods are black box models that cannot adequately reveal information hidden in the data. In the medical setting, extracted rules must be not only highly accurate, but also highly interpretable. The Recursive-Rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm is a white box model that generates highly accurate and interpretable classification rules on the basis of both discrete and continuous attributes; however, it tends to generate more rules than other rule extraction algorithms. The objectives of this study were to use a new rule extraction algorithm, Continuous Re-RX combined with sampling selection techniques (Sampling-Continuous Re-RX), to achieve highly accurate and interpretable diagnostic rules for the BUPA and Hepatitis datasets and to quantify the associations between the presence and severity of ascites and serum biomarkers with the risk of developing hepatitis in consideration of Child-Pugh scores. The performance of Sampling-Continuous Re-RX was compared with existing techniques, and as a result, it was found to extract more accurate, concise, and interpretable rules for the BUPA and Hepatitis datasets compared with previous extraction algorithms. In addition, the rules extracted using the proposed method were close to the trade-off curve, which indicated that they were more accurate and interpretable, and therefore more suitable in the medical setting.","2016-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","26-38","","","5","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Rule extraction; Re-RX algorithm; BUPA liver disorder dataset; Child-Pugh score; Hepatitis dataset; Sampling selection technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the seemingly double-impact theory and the rolling bearing fault mechanism, a theoretical model for the bearing fault with different spall-like fault sizes is developed and analyzed, and the seemingly double-impact characteristic of the bearing faults is explained. The first action that causes a bearing fault is due to the entry of the roller element into the spall-like fault which can be described as a step-like response. The second action is the exit of the roller element from the spall-like fault, which can be described as an impulse-like response. Based on the quantitative relationship between the time interval of the seemingly double-impact actions and the fault size, a novel matching pursuit method is proposed based on a new step-impulse dictionary. In addition, the quantitative matching pursuit algorithm is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis based on the new dictionary model. Finally, an atomic selection mechanism is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy of bearing fault size. The simulation results of this study indicate that the new matching pursuit method based on the new step-impulse dictionary can be reliably used to measure the sizes of bearing spall-like faults.

A randomised controlled pilot trial was conducted. Recruited patients were on a waiting list and had a primary diagnosis of either social phobia or panic disorder. Participants were randomised into either receiving iCBT with minimal therapist contact (received access to the programme FearFighter® (FF) and received support from a clinician via telephone) or no treatment (stayed on the waiting list). The primary outcome was self-reported symptomatic change of anxiety on Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The secondary outcomes were comorbid depression measured on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and quality of life measured with the EuroQol one-item visual-analogue scale (EQ-vas). All results were analysed by intention-to-treat analyses using a mixed-effects approach. N=158 patients were assessed for eligibility of which N=67 met all eligibility inclusion criteria, signed informed consent forms, and were randomised. Post-treatment assessment was completed by N=47 (70%). In the intervention group, N=11 (31%) completed all modules of FF. No significant differences of change of symptomatic levels were found between the intervention and control group for anxiety (BAI: mean diff.=2.42; 95% CI −1.03 to 5.86; p=0.17; d=0.06) or for depression (BDI-II: mean diff. 1.87; 95% CI −2.25 to 6.00; p=0.37; d=0.02).

This study was not able to document statistically significant clinical effect of iCBT with minimal therapist contact compared to a waiting list control group in a specialised anxiety clinic in routine care.

Photofragmentation is performed with a pump laser pulse of 80ps duration and a wavelength of 266nm, whereupon the produced OH photofragments are detected by a second picosecond probe laser pulse, inducing fluorescence via excitation in the A2Σ+(v=1) ← X2Π(v=0) band of OH near 283nm. Excitation spectra of the OH photofragments formed in the reaction zone were recorded for pump-probe delays ranging from 0 to 5ns. The spectra suggest that the population distribution of the nascent OH fragments is rotationally cold and that it takes on the order of 5ns for the nascent non-equilibrium rotational distribution to relax into a thermal distribution. The radial OH-fragment distribution was extracted from spectral images (radial position versus emission wavelength) recorded at six different pump-probe delays. Photochemical OH production was observed both in the reaction zone and the product zone. Comparison with a kinetic model for OH production suggests that more than 20% of the oxygen fragments produced by photolysis in the reaction zone are formed in the excited 1D state, explaining a very rapid initial signal growth. The OH-production model was also compared with previous reaction-zone data, acquired with nanosecond laser pulses in the same flame, indicating that no O(1D), but only O(3P), is formed. A plausible explanation of the discrepancy between the two results is that the picosecond pulses, having more than two-orders of magnitude higher irradiance than the nanosecond pulses used in the previous study, might cause 2-photon photodissociation, allowing production of O(1D). In terms of flame diagnostics with PFLIF, it is concluded that a setup based on nanosecond laser pulses, rather than picosecond pulses, appears preferable since photochemical OH production in the reaction zone can be avoided while for short delay times the ratio between the photofragment signal and the photochemical interference in the product zone, stemming from CO2 photolysis, is sufficiently large to clearly visualize the photofragments.","2016-09-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","59-68","","","171","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Photofragmentation; Laser-induced fluorescence; Combustion diagnostics; Comparison picosecond and nanosecond excitation; Hydroperoxyl radical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unsteady jet flame is characterized by rapid ignition followed by a gradual blowout of the flame. Audio recordings and Schlieren imaging high speed videos are used in investigating the unsteady flame. The frequency of the blowout re-ignition event is investigated as a function of nitrogen dilution mole fraction (YN2=0.180–0.566), co-flow equivalence ratio (Φcf=0.20–0.27) and jet velocity (Vjet=300–500m/s). The results from the audio recordings and Schlieren imaging indicate that autoignition dominates the re-ignition. The frequency of ignition increase with increasing nitrogen dilution until a maximum is reached after which it decreases with further nitrogen dilution. For increasing equivalence ratios a higher nitrogen dilution is needed in the jet for the flame to become unsteady. The effect of the nitrogen dilution is explained primarily through a reduction in reaction rates and increased jet momentum.

A multiple level feature set, including pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNN), is extracted from 106 hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy tissue studies from 106 women patients. These multi-level features allow not only characterization of cancer morphology, but also extraction of structural and interpretable information within the histopathological images. In this study, an improved hybrid active contour model based segmentation method was used to segment nuclei from the images. The semantic-level features were extracted by a CNN approach, which described the proportions of nuclei belonging to the different grades, in conjunction with pixel-level (texture) and object-level (architecture) features, to create an integrated set of image attributes that can potentially outperform either subtype of features individually. We utilized a cascaded approach to train multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using combinations of feature subtypes to enable the possibility of maximizing the performance by leveraging different feature sets extracted from multiple levels. Final class (cancer grade) was determined by combining the scores produced by the individual SVM classifiers. By employing a light (three-layer) CNN model and parallel computing, the presented approach is computationally efficient and applicable to large-scale datasets. The method achieved an accuracy of 0.92 for low versus high, 0.77 for low versus intermediate, and 0.76 for intermediate versus high, and an overall accuracy of 0.69 when discriminating low, intermediate, and high grades of histopathological breast cancer images.

The aim of this study was to validate dual energy X-rays absorptiometry (DXA)-based finite element (FE) models to predict femoral strength in two loading configurations. Thirty-six pairs of fresh frozen human proximal femora were scanned with DXA and quantitative computed tomography (QCT). For each pair one femur was tested until failure in a one-legged standing configuration (STANCE) and one by replicating the position of the femur in a fall onto the greater trochanter (SIDE). Subject-specific 2D DXA-based linear FE models and 3D QCT-based nonlinear FE models were generated for each specimen and used to predict the measured femoral strength. The outcomes of the models were compared to standard DXA-based areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements. For the STANCE configuration the DXA-based FE models (R2=0.74, SEE=1473N) outperformed the best densitometric predictor (Neck_aBMD, R2=0.66, SEE=1687N) but not the QCT-based FE models (R2=0.80, SEE=1314N). For the SIDE configuration both QCT-based FE models (R2=0.85, SEE=455N) and DXA neck aBMD (R2=0.80, SEE=502N) outperformed DXA-based FE models (R2=0.77, SEE=529N). In both configurations the DXA-based FE model provided a good 1:1 agreement with the experimental data (CC=0.87 for SIDE and CC=0.86 for STANCE), with proper optimization of the failure criteria. In conclusion we found that the DXA-based FE models are a good predictor of femoral strength as compared with experimental data ex vivo.

In this paper, fundamental HCCI engine experiments are proposed as a means for characterizing the impact of these technologies on the knock propensity of different fuels. In particular, the impacts of turbocharging, direct injection (DI), and downspeeding on operation with ethanol and gasoline are investigated to demonstrate this approach. Results reported earlier for ethanol and gasoline on HCCI combustion are revisited with the new perspective of how their autoignition characteristics fit into the anti-knock requirement in modern SI engines. For example, the weak sensitivity to pressure boost demonstrated by ethanol in HCCI autoignition can be used to explain the strong knock resistance of ethanol fuels for turbocharged SI engines. Further, ethanol's high sensitivity to charge temperature makes charge cooling, which can be produced by fuel vaporization via direct injection or by piston expansion via spark-timing retard, very effective for inhibiting knock. On the other hand, gasoline autoignition shows a higher sensitivity to pressure, so only very low pressure boost can be applied before knock occurs. Gasoline also demonstrates low temperature sensitivity, so it is unable to make as effective use of the charge cooling produced by fuel vaporization or spark retard. These arguments comprehensively explain literature results on ethanol's substantially better anti-knock performance over gasoline in modern turbocharged DISI engines. Fundamental HCCI experiments such as these can thus be used as a diagnostic and predictive tool for knock-limited SI engine performance for various fuels. Examples are presented where HCCI experiments are used to identify biofuel compounds with good potential for modern SI-engine applications.","2015-10-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","4008-4015","","10","162","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","DISI; Ethanol; HCCI; Knock propensity; Turbocharging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a new methodology based on the gene expression profiles to classify human cancer diseases. The proposed methodology combines both Information Gain (IG) and Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA). It first uses Information Gain for feature selection, then uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature reduction and finally uses Genetic Programming (GP) for cancer types’ classification. The suggested system is evaluated by classifying cancer diseases in seven cancer datasets and the results are compared with most latest approaches.

In this article, we present a hierarchical probabilistic framework to discover the stereotypical and idiosyncratic viewing behaviors exhibited with expertise-specific groups. Through these patterned eye movement behaviors we are able to elicit the domain-specific knowledge and perceptual skills from the subjects whose eye movements are recorded during diagnostic reasoning processes on medical images. Analyzing experts’ eye movement patterns provides us insight into cognitive strategies exploited to solve complex perceptual reasoning tasks. An experiment was conducted to collect both eye movement and verbal narrative data from three groups of subjects with different levels or no medical training (eleven board-certified dermatologists, four dermatologists in training and thirteen undergraduates) while they were examining and describing 50 photographic dermatological images. We use a hidden Markov model to describe each subject’s eye movement sequence combined with hierarchical stochastic processes to capture and differentiate the discovered eye movement patterns shared by multiple subjects within and among the three groups. Independent experts’ annotations of diagnostic conceptual units of thought in the transcribed verbal narratives are time-aligned with discovered eye movement patterns to help interpret the patterns’ meanings. By mapping eye movement patterns to thought units, we uncover the relationships between visual and linguistic elements of their reasoning and perceptual processes, and show the manner in which these subjects varied their behaviors while parsing the images. We also show that inferred eye movement patterns characterize groups of similar temporal and spatial properties, and specify a subset of distinctive eye movement patterns which are commonly exhibited across multiple images. Based on the combinations of the occurrences of these eye movement patterns, we are able to categorize the images from the perspective of experts’ viewing strategies in a novel way. In each category, images share similar lesion distributions and configurations. Our results show that modeling with multi-modal data, representative of physicians’ diagnostic viewing behaviors and thought processes, is feasible and informative to gain insights into physicians’ cognitive strategies, as well as medical image understanding.","2016-10-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","138-152","","","151","","Computer Vision and Image Understanding","","Probabilistic Models for Biomedical Image Analysis","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Combinatorial stochastic processes; Diagnostic reasoning; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Multi-modal data; Nonparametric Bayesian method; Probabilistic modeling; Visual attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an issue of critical importance in imaging studies seeking to determine which anatomical or physiological imaging features contribute to the classifier’s decision, thereby allowing users to critically evaluate the findings of such machine learning methods and to understand disease mechanisms. The majority of published work addresses the question of statistical inference for support vector classification using permutation tests based on SVM weight vectors. Such permutation testing ignores the SVM margin, which is critical in SVM theory. In this work we emphasize the use of a statistic that explicitly accounts for the SVM margin and show that the null distributions associated with this statistic are asymptotically normal. Further, our experiments show that this statistic is a lot less conservative as compared to weight based permutation tests and yet specific enough to tease out multivariate patterns in the data.

The experimental setup, equipped with temperature diagnostics and schlieren imaging, utilizes a glow plug to initiate ignition in a flammable mixture. The hot-surface temperature at the point of ignition is measured for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.6 to 3 and chamber pressures varying from 25 to 100 kPa. The hot-surface temperature resulting in ignition is found to be weakly sensitive to equivalence ratio with a mean value of 980 K for mixtures with equivalence ratios between 0.75 and 3 at 100 kPa. Chamber pressure has a stronger influence with ignition temperature increasing to about 1140 K at 25 kPa. The experimental trends were reproduced in numerical simulations utilizing detailed chemistry of n-heptane as a surrogate for n-hexane given their similar ignition and flame propagation characteristics. The simulations further predict a two-stage ignition process resulting from an initial breakdown of the fuel with a small increase in temperature followed by a main ignition event accompanied by fuel depletion. Reaction rate analysis of the sequence of events leading to ignition conducted using a reduced order kinetic model suggests that the second-stage ignition event is caused primarily by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which occurs at temperatures above 900 K. The two-stage ignition process observed here is significantly different from that observed in previous studies due to the presence of convective and diffusive processes as well as the continuous increase in hot-surface temperature. These arguments are used to explain the insensitivity of ignition temperature to equivalence ratio, its decrease with increasing chamber pressure, and the location of the ignition kernel observed in experiments and simulations.","2016-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","42-53","","","163","","Combustion and Flame","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Detailed chemistry; Heptane; Hexane; Hot-surface ignition; Two-stage ignition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this work is to perform a computational study to gain insight into the hemodynamic forces that drive blood flow steal mechanisms caused by subclavian artery stenosis. Such condition triggers a flow disorder known as subclavian steal. When this occurs in patients with internal thoracic artery anastomosed to the coronary vessels, the phenomenon includes a coronary-subclavian steal. True steal can exist in cases of increased arm blood flow, potentially resulting in neurological complications and, in the case of coronary-subclavian steal, graft function failure. In this context, the anatomically detailed arterial network (ADAN) model is employed to simulate subclavian steal and coronary-subclavian steal phenomena. Model results are verified by comparison with published data. It is concluded that this kind of model allows us to effectively address complex hemomdynamic phenomena occurring in clinical practice. More specifically, in the studied conditions it is observed that a regional brain steal occurs, primarily affecting the posterior circulation, not fully compensated by the anterior circulation. In the case of patients with coronary revascularization, it is concluded that there is a large variability in graft hemodynamic environments, which physically explain both the success of the procedure in cases of severe occlusive disease, and the reason for graft dysfunction in mildly stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery, due to alternating graft flow waveform signatures.","2016-06-14","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","1593-1600","","9","49","","Journal of Biomechanics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","1D Model; Coronary revascularization; Coronary-subclavian steal; Numerical simulation; Subclavian steal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system was developed to extract quantitative strain features from elastographic images to reduce operator-dependence and provide an automatic procedure for breast mass classification. Method The collected image database was composed of 45 malignant and 45 benign breast masses. For each case, tumor segmentation was performed on the B-mode image to obtain tumor contour which was then mapped to the elastographic images to define the corresponding tumor area. The gray-scale pixels around tumor area were classified into white, gray, and black by fuzzy c-means clustering to highlight stiff tissues with darker values. Quantitative strain features were then extracted from the black cluster and compared with the B-mode features in the classification of breast masses. Results The performance of the proposed strain features achieved an accuracy of 80% (72/90), a sensitivity of 80% (36/45), a specificity of 80% (36/45), and a normalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Az=0.84.

The occurrence of these situations emphasizes the importance of extending the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation, assuming the simultaneous presence of more than one inhibitor because reaction product is always present. This methodology is illustrated with the reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase inhibited by phosphate (reaction product, inhibitor 1) and urea (inhibitor 2). The approach is explained in a step by step manner using an Excel spreadsheet (available as a template in Appendix). Curve fitting by nonlinear regression was performed with the Solver add-in (Microsoft Office Excel). Discrimination of the kinetic models was carried out based on Akaike information criterion. This work presents a methodology that can be used to develop an automated process, to discriminate in real time the inhibition type and kinetic constants as data (product vs. time) are achieved by the spectrophotometer.","2016-03-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","2-7","","","125","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition; General mechanism kinetics; Integrated Michaelis–Menten equations; Linear inhibition; Two inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of a fixed loading level for stiffness damage testing, as previously suggested in the literature, limits its ability to reliably appraise the distress level of concrete samples, especially when different concrete strengths and aggregate types are used. Moreover, the test input and output parameters should be properly interpreted so that the SDT becomes a powerful diagnostic procedure. This paper presents an evaluation of the practical use of the SDT in engineering purposes. Results show that the use of output indices, i.e. SDI and PDI, instead of absolute output values, makes the procedure more diagnostic (i.e. ≠ distress degrees can be easier distinguished) and less influenced by practical assumptions (e.g. choice of the loading level for stiffness damage testing). Based on the prior results, a step-by-step standard test procedure is proposed aiming to minimize the test variability.","2016-10-30","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","1178-1188","","","125","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Degradation; Alkali-aggregate reaction; Crack detection; Durability; Expansion; Stiffness Damage Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most controversial question of these algorithms is their poor performance on real world applications. To overcome such limitation this research work focuses on generating more efficient detectors through a more flexible boundary for self-patterns. Rather than applying conventional affinity measures, the detectors are generated benefiting from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted on normal space. From the GMM capabilities the algorithm is able to dynamically determine efficient subsets of detectors. In order to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, different data sets have been examined as benchmark, including 2D synthesis data sets. Furthermore, for evaluating the capability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real-world problems, it has been performed and tested for detecting anomalies in archaeological sites located in Lorestan, Iran. The experimental results prove how the proposed approach helps the negative selection algorithm to improve its detection capability, because the detectors can be efficiently distributed into the non-self space. It is important to note how this research work presents also a first analysis of the anomaly detection capabilities in the field of archaeology, introducing a novel application method, which can be efficiently used by the archaeologists for interpreting their growing amount of data and draw valuable conclusions about the historical past. Finally, in order to analyse the convergence and the running time of the proposed algorithm, a study has been conducted using the classical Time-To-Target plots, which present a standard graphical methodology for data analysis based on the comparisons between the empirical and theoretical distributions.","2017-06-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","359-372","","","62","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DENSA","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Artificial Immune System; DENSA; Gaussian Mixture Model; Negative selection algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, we explain how an EMS's Optimal Power Flow (OPF) module can be exploited by accidental or deliberate changes in a power system model. As a defense mechanism, for the first time, we propose a graph comparison-based approach for identifying anomalies in an electric network DB. In this study, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and use the Graduated Assignment algorithm to perform graph matching. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider different test scenarios considering the IEEE benchmark 24-bus, 30-bus and 118-bus test systems.

Therefore, a safer and complementary method of diagnosis is to employ the use of an expert system in order to initiate a platform for pre-clinical treatments, thus acting as a precursor to comprehensive medical diagnosis and treatments. This work presents a design and implementation of informatics software and a knowledge-based expert system for the diagnosis, and provision of recommendations on the appropriate type of recommended treatment to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). In this research an Ebola fuzzy informatics system was developed for the purpose of diagnosing and providing useful recommendations to the management of the EVD in West Africa and other affected regions of the world. It also acts as a supplementary resource in providing medical advice to individuals in Ebola – ravaged countries. This aim was achieved through the following objectives: (i) gathering of facts through the conduct of a comprehensive continental survey to determine the knowledge and perception level of the public about factors responsible for the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (ii) develop an informatics software based on information collated from health institutions on basic diagnosis of the Ebola Virus Disease-related symptoms (iii) adopting and marrying the knowledge of fuzzy logic and expert systems in developing the informatics software. Necessary requirements were collated from the review of existing expert systems, consultation of journals and articles, and internet sources. Online survey was conducted to determine the level at which individuals are aware of the factors responsible for the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The expert system developed, was designed to use fuzzy logic as its inference mechanism along with a set of rules. A knowledge base was created to help provide diagnosis on the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The Root Sum Square (RSS) was adopted as a fuzzy inference method. The degree of participation of each input parameter was shown using the triangular membership function and the defuzzification technique used is the Center of Gravity (CoG). The resulting software produced a user-friendly desktop-based, Windows-based, application and the tools used were explained in the results section in three (3) separate phases. First, a comprehensive online survey was conducted over a period of about 3–9 months. 100 Participants participated in the survey on the perception and knowledge analysis of different individuals about Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) transmission factors. 31% of the participants didn't know that there is presently no cure for Ebola. 28% believed that there is presently a cure for Ebola. 43% agreed that Ebola is both air-borne and water-borne, while 33% disagreed, 24% do not know. 23% believed that insects and mosquitoes can help in transmitting the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), while 30% were completely ignorant. We noticed that ignorance was a major limiting factor among some participants. Second, a test was conducted among 45 people. Results from a comprehensive testing of the Ebinformatics software by allowing users to operate and use the software, revealed that 60% of them were satisfied, while 16% were not satisfied with the software, while 24% were indifferent. 69% of the users were in agreement that Ebinformatics was supportive, 20% disagreed, while 11% were indifferent. 67% found the software easy to use, 13% disagreed, while 20% were indifferent. Third, the output of the software, showing the various diagnosis and recommendations interfaces were presented. Recommendations were also given with respect to how the system can be extended, and further improved upon.","2016-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","12-37","","","2","","Informatics in Medicine Unlocked","Ebinformatics","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Diagnosis; Informatics; Ebola; Fuzzy; Recommender","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is suitable for experience-based and theory-less problems. Building a semantically intelligent CBR that mimic the expert thinking can solve many problems especially medical ones. Methods Knowledge-intensive CBR using formal ontologies is an evolvement of this paradigm. Ontologies can be used for case representation and storage, and it can be used as a background knowledge. Using standard medical ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, enhances the interoperability and integration with the health care systems. Moreover, utilizing vague or imprecise knowledge further improves the CBR semantic effectiveness. This paper proposes a fuzzy ontology-based CBR framework. It proposes a fuzzy case-base OWL2 ontology, and a fuzzy semantic retrieval algorithm that handles many feature types. Material This framework is implemented and tested on the diabetes diagnosis problem. The fuzzy ontology is populated with 60 real diabetic cases. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a set of experiments and case studies. Results The resulting system can answer complex medical queries related to semantic understanding of medical concepts and handling of vague terms. The resulting fuzzy case-base ontology has 63 concepts, 54 (fuzzy) object properties, 138 (fuzzy) datatype properties, 105 fuzzy datatypes, and 2640 instances. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.67%. We compare our framework with existing CBR systems and a set of five machine-learning classifiers; our system outperforms all of these systems. Conclusion Building an integrated CBR system can improve its performance. Representing CBR knowledge using the fuzzy ontology and building a case retrieval algorithm that treats different features differently improves the accuracy of the resulting systems.","2015-11-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","179-208","","3","65","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Case-based reasoning; Diabetes diagnosis; Fuzzy ontology; Knowledge based system; Semantic retrieval; Standard SNOMED CT terminology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ASA score plays an important role in patients' preanesthetic evaluation. In this paper, we propose a methodology to derive simple rules which classify patients in a category of the ASA scale on the basis of their medical characteristics. Methods This diagnosis system is based on MR-Sort, a multiple criteria decision analysis model. The proposed method intends to support two steps in this process. The first is the assignment of an ASA score to the patient; the second concerns the decision to accept—or not—the patient for surgery. Results In order to learn the model parameters and assess its effectiveness, we use a database containing the parameters of 898 patients who underwent preanesthesia evaluation. The accuracy of the learned models for predicting the ASA score and the decision of accepting the patient for surgery is assessed and proves to be better than that of other machine learning methods. Furthermore, simple decision rules can be explicitly derived from the learned model. These are easily interpretable by doctors, and their consistency with medical knowledge can be checked. Conclusions The proposed model for assessing the ASA score produces accurate predictions on the basis of the (limited) set of patient attributes in the database available for the tests. Moreover, the learned MR-Sort model allows for easy interpretation by providing human-readable classification rules.","2016-09-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:22","183-193","","","133","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Classification; ASA score; MR-Sort; Multiple criteria decision support; Preanesthesia evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Signaling system designers have to consider the possible faults which may occur in railway field components both on the requirements preparation phase and on the development phase of the signaling system software or namely, the interlocking system. Although the diagnosis of different unobservable faults is relatively hard, especially for large scale railway fields, this complexity can be overcome by using the Discrete Event System (DES) based modular diagnosis approach which is explained in this paper. The main advantage of using such modular approach for fault diagnosis in fixed-block signaling systems is the inspection of the diagnosability of the whole system with respect to its subsystems (railway field components). In this study, the diagnosability of the railway field equipment and the whole system is also explained with a case study.","2016-01-01","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","2021-06-05 17:33:23","459-464","","3","49","","IFAC-PapersOnLine","","14th IFAC Symposium on Control in Transportation SystemsCTS 2016","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Discrete Event Systems; Fixed-Block Railway Signaling Systems; Modular Fault Diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
